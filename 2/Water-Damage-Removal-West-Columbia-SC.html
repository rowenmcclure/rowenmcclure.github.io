<p>Mold can trigger serious health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown inadequate against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really assists in mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Step 5: Restoration - The greatest action in the process is restoration. Restoration includes changing products like drywall and insulation. Sometimes this process is as simple as installing a few panels of drywall, while serious cases could need changing whole walls. Direct exposure to poisonous compounds like lead and asbestos is possible during restoration. Older homes are likely to contain these compounds.</p>

Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, but when he discovered just how much water bill I was paying since the leak began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He discovered & marked the location of the leakage for me and after that even helped me closed down my main water valve. Easy-going and really polite person.</p>

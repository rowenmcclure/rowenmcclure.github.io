Mold spores are like small seeds, drifting through the air until they land someplace. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will sprout and grow. Mold works the very same way, so if the location the spores land is wet and good, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a huge problem on your hands.</p>

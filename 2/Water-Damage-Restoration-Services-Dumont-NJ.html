<p>Since common structure materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is typically related to water or moisture exposure and might be caused by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>

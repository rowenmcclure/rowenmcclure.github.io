<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. In some cases it will be apparent that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above.

<p>Because typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is generally associated with water or moisture exposure and might be caused by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

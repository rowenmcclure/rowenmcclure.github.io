<p>Because typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is normally associated with water or moisture direct exposure and might be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor travels through walls and ceilings, usually condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season.

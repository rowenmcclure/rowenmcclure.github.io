<p>You wish to attend to bathroom flooding as rapidly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and produces a best breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew. These 10 actions get you on the road to flooded bathroom healing. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the area to lift and unsettle the dampened mold. Move the brush in careful strong strokes so you aren't sprinkling the mold on the surrounding locations-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health problem. After scrubbing completely with the brush, wipe the area clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
<p>9. Eliminate the furnishings and floor covering. Clean your furniture and let dry completely. Floor covering is tough to save, especially when flooded with polluted water like river water or sewage system water. You may be able to save your floor covering if you were flooded with clean water and it's bone dry within 24 hr. If not, rip it up. To prevent mold in the bathroom, make certain to open windows if you have them to enhance ventilation and run the fan when showering, cleaning or shaving. Wipe water off difficult surface areas, like shower walls and sinks, and repair plumbing leaks as quickly as possible. Scrub mold from surface areas as soon as it appears, then be sure to dry the location to prevent it from spreading out.<p>

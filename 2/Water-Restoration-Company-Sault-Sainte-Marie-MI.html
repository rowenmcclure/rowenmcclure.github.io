<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. In some cases it will be apparent that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls might reveal noticeable indications of moisture, leaking water, or signs of failing structural integrity. Ceiling drywall panels may sag or crumble under the weight of water that fills the naturally porous gypsum material. Other times, you may observe little signs like coffee-colored discolorations that may broaden over time.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that common structure products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is generally related to water or wetness direct exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can result in interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, usually condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>

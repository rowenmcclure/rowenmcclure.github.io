<h3>Fire Damage Restoration in Fowlerville - Restore Your Home and Your Life After Fire</h3>
<p>Get rid of paneling, wallboard and plaster to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be an irreversible health risk and need to be eliminated. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the idea of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>

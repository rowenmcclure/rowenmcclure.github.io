<p>Recent Review: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the water company told me if it's addressing the current rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, however when he found out how much water costs I was paying since the leak began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He marked the location & discovered of the leakage for me and then even helped me closed down my main water valve. Easy-going and extremely polite person.</p>

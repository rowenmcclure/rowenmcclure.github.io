<h3>Why You Should Hire Fredericktown Professionals for Your Fire Damage</h3>
<p>When you are planning large repairs, remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By minimizing the thickness here, it's much easier to conceal long taped seams under a number of coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is very important to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise remember that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the job is completed.<p>

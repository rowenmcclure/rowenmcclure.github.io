If the moldy area is dry, lightly spray with water, as this will reduce the occurrence of airborne mold spores throughout cleaning. Next, utilize commercial black mold removal products, which can be discovered in the majority of hardware or home repair stores, to sanitize the moldy locations, in addition to any surrounding areas.

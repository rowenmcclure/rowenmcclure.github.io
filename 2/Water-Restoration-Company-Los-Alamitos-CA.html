Conditions favorable to drying at the surface area vary from moving excess moisture within the assemblies or materials. Quick air motion across the surface area of material ends up being lesser relative to vapor pressure as the focus of eliminating surface moisture gives way to minimizing moisture material in low evaporation products. The constant and falling rates of drying materials require different requirements for changing conditions.</p>

<p>If you're dealing with a smaller hole (up to 6"), use a thin layer of joint compound around the hole. Put your spot into the hole. Utilizing a putty knife, work the paper edge down into the substance. Feather the edges of the substance and allow it to dry. Sand gently with a fine-grit sandpaper and use a second layer of joint compound to complete the repair.

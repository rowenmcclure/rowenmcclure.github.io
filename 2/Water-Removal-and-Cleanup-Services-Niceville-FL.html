<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is actually made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does. Many people think that because smoke rises into the air, diffusion happens, and it just goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this suggests that the smoke will spread out, harming a much broader location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration techniques will include searching a wide area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>

Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in products that have actually become infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become air-borne.</p>

<h3>Basement Water Problems in West Boylston Massachusetts</h2>
<p>Particular areas of your home such as crawl attics, basements and spaces are a lot more vulnerable to water damage. Dark, wet crawl areas can be a sanctuary for mold and mildew, which is turn can then cause structural damage as they thrive. The concrete foundation of your home can trigger leaking in the basement if there is wetness dripping through it. Condensation in the area in between the attic and your home can cause wetness on the underside of the roof, which can result in mold and decomposing. When examining your home for possible causes of water damage make sure to watch out for moisture in lighting fixtures in addition to the overall condition of any obvious piping.</p>
<p>When standing water is removed, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually soaked up (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) get rid of the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure includes examining ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily dependent on temperature too, so cooling a room down with outside air can likewise set a drying job back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service professionals prior to you make any adjustments if you have questions on this.</p>

<p>Check the drywall to see how much damage has been done. Heavily water-infiltrated wallboard will droop from ceilings or fall apart to the touch. Remove all compromised drywall by hand or utilize the claw end of a hammer or a wrecking bar to eliminate it. If drywall panels just show water discolorations but aren't structurally compromised, they might be repairable by cutting out the damaged part. When eliminating around the damaged area, utilize a keyhole saw to cut the hole into a square or rectangular shape. You can then make a spot with another piece of drywall for the repair.<p>

If possible and run a dehumidifier, open windows and doors. You can also use air movers to rapidly dry the surface.<p>

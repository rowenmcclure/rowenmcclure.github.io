<p>The primary step in solving an indoor mold issue is to remove the wetness source; 18 new mold will begin to grow on damp, porous surfaces within 24 to two days. There are a number of methods to prevent mold development. Some cleaning companies focus on fabric restoration, eliminating mold (and mold spores) from clothes to remove odor and prevent additional damage to garments. Knowing the potential causes of water damage helps you make the right choice about what remediation services and products are required.<p>
<p>Mold requires nutrients, water, oxygen and favorable temperatures to grow. Nutrients for mold exist in dead organic material such as wood, paper or fabrics; mold can also obtain nutrients from some synthetic items such as paints and adhesives. Mold needs wetness, although some mold types can acquire that wetness from wet air when the relative humidity is above 70 per cent. Thoroughly pry baseboards away from walls so that you can check sheetrock at floor level. The porous product can quickly absorb flood water, and you need to understand the extent of potential damage.<p>

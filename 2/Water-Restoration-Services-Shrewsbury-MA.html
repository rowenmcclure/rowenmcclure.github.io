<p>If smoke and fire damage has actually affected your possessions, we will work with you and your insurance company to identify what can be brought back, and what will be an insurance coverage replacement claim. For products that can be restored, we use ultrasonic cleaning to restore your damaged valuables. For this, we utilized Zinsser's Water Based Peel-Stop What this does is act like a glue which permeates into porous surface area, avoiding water from permeating back through. Essentially, it makes the location strong once again and secures the surface from future water damage. After you have actually used the Peel-Stop, allow for an hour of drying time.<p>

If you experience water damage, it is very important NOT to take a knee jerk response. It's best to call your insurance company immediately. Picking the restoration company is totally chosen by the home owner.<p>

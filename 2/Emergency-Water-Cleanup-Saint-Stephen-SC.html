<p>Mold can cause severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven inadequate versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>

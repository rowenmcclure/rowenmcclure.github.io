<p>Water invasion into structures can be incredibly destructive. Once InstaScope was produced, we engaged a group of scientists at the University of Colorado. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, a globally acknowledged professional on the biological aspects of air contamination, this group was designated to validate and test the brand-new technology. Needless to state, it passed with flying colors. Together, we were able to produce a new mold-assessment system for commercial clients that, unlike any other method or gadget, can provide clinically accurate, area-by-area results-- and do so instantly. So when you consider all the risks of mold, InstaScope is a vital tool to help guarantee the health of your home and the health of your household.</p>

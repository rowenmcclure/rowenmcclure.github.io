<p>If your home has mold you ought to ensure it is it looked after as quickly as you can.  Mold can spread out really rapidly, and it is more than just black spots. As it grows, it can break down the "food" that supports it, which can be the wooden studs supporting your walls, the sheetrock itself, or any other natural, permeable materials in your house. That can be problem for your residential or commercial property, let alone for your health.<p>

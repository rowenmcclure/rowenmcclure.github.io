<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is actually made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot substance that can damage the surface areas it touches, simply as fire does. Many people think that due to the fact that smoke rises into the air, diffusion takes place, and it simply disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this implies that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much larger area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is enabled to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration methods will include searching a wide location to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>

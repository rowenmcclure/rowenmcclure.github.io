Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, however when he found out how much water bill I was paying considering that the leak began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the place of the leak for me and then even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Easy-going and very respectful person.</p>

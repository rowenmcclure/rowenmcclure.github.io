Mold is a natural part of the environment and plays an important part in nature by breaking down dead raw material such as fallen leaves and dead trees; inside, mold growth should be avoided. Mold reproduce by methods of small spores. The spores resemble seeds, but unnoticeable to the naked eye, that float through the air and deposit on surface areas. When the temperature, moisture, and available nutrient conditions are appropriate, the spores can form into brand-new mold colonies where they are transferred. 1 There are many kinds of mold, but all require moisture and a food source for growth.</p>

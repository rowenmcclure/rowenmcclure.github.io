<p>Mold can cause major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown inadequate versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Because typical building materials can sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or wetness direct exposure and may be caused by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, generally condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

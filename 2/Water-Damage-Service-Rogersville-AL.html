<h3>Fire Damage Restoration in Rogersville - Restore Your Home and Your Life After Fire</h3>
<p>Eliminate paneling, plaster and wallboard to at least the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be a long-term health threat and should be gotten rid of. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the suggestion of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>

Move the brush in careful strong strokes so you aren't splashing the mold on the surrounding areas-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health concern. After scrubbing thoroughly with the brush, clean the area clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>

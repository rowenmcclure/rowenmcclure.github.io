<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. As pointed out, rapid air motion throughout damp surfaces of products or assemblies is an important element of successfully and effectively drying the surface area of those products and assemblies. Conditions favorable to drying at the surface differ from moving excess wetness within the products or assemblies. Quick air movement across the surface area of material becomes less important relative to vapor pressure as the focus of removing surface area moisture gives way to lowering moisture material in low evaporation materials. The continuous and falling rates of drying products require various requirements for altering conditions.</p>

<p>Once standing water is gotten rid of, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has soaked up (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) get rid of the wetness in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking process includes examining ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily based on temperature also, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying job back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service professionals prior to you make any adjustments.</p>

<h3>From Fire Water Restoration to Mold Removal in Kyle</h3>
<p>If mold currently exists, that does not mean it can not be avoided in the future, however. Any structure, from brand name brand-new construction to a decades old home, will get value out of avoidance approaches that keep mold from growing.

In some cases avoidance gets neglected throughout the rush to get rid of a problem that already exists, but our company believe preventative steps can use enduring security. Our remediation process includes avoidance of future development for these reasons.

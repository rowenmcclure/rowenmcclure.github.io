<p>Water invasion into structures can be incredibly destructive. Jake and his guys were incredible in assisting us make it through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to your house and started drying our drenched crawlspace immediately. They came back every day (frequently twice a day) to monitor and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed whatever they were doing along the way and also were really practical in collaborating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than fair on the expenses and I 'd recommend them without hesitation.</p>
<p>Crawl areas often grow mold for the same factors as basements do-they tend to stay damp long-term.

Because of the size and ventilation, cleanup in this location is normally less extreme, so cleaning and eliminating affected locations is typically enough.</p>

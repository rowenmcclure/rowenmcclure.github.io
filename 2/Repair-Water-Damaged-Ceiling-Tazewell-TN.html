<p>Negative air devices, equipped with HEPA (high efficiency particulate air filters") must be utilized to eliminate bacteria and other contaminants from the air throughout restoration work. Standing water and bulk sewage should be extracted with self-contained vacuum devices with correct waste holding tanks which need to be dealt with properly. Tough surface areas that are impacted need to be cleaned up and sterilized. Soft structural materials such as carpets, rug, plaster wallboard must be gotten rid of and correctly dealt with. Any material that takes in substantial amounts of moisture and can not be sufficiently cleaned up must be eliminated. When contaminated materials have been removed, a second application of sanitizers must be used to all work surfaces.</p>

<p>Any building that has actually suffered from water damage or problems with excess wetness is at risk of mold development. Erosion to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to prolonged water exposure and requires masonry work to repair. Permanent staining on floorings and walls is another prospective effect of water damage. Walls and floor covering might need replacement or refinishing depending upon the level of damage. Moldy smells can linger in a home where leakages or flooding have actually occurred and this might be a sign of excess mold and mildew growth.</p>
<p>To keep indoor surfaces as dry as possible, attempt to keep the home's relative humidity between 20-40 percent in the Winter season and less than 60 percent the remainder of the year.

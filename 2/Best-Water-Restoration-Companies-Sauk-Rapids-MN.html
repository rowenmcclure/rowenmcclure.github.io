<p>Remove wallboard, plaster and paneling to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. It can be an irreversible health hazard and need to be eliminated if soaked by infected floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls.

A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the pointer of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>

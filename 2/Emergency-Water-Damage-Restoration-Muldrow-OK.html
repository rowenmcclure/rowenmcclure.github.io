<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be more convenient due to the fact that it is self-adhesive, lots of expert drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I prefer paper tape, too.

When the meters read moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the technician will eliminate the fans and dehumidifiers from the location. At this point, the water remediation procedure is thought about to finish.<p>

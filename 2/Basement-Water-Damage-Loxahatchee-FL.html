<p>Mold can cause serious health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. Experts have actually identified Pennsylvania the center of an industrywide epidemic that has actually affected stretching rural homes, starter homes, and luxury Philadelphia townhouses alike.

<p>Since typical structure materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally associated with water or wetness exposure and may be caused by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor travels through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>

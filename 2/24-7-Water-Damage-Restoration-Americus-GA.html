These filters are tested and accredited to 99.99% HEPA performance, which implies that they get rid of a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size.

<p>These are normally good indicators of mold, potentially hazardous and certainly something you want to eliminate. The taxonomic name for the greenish-black mold that shows up on carpet, wallpaper, and ceiling tiles is Stachybotrys Chartarum or Black Mold.

This needs certified mold removal, mold testing, and black mold remediation experts in Seattle, like those from Pacific Rim CR LLC.<p>

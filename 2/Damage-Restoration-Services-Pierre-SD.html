<p>Learn how to get rid of black mold safely and efficiently. If you choose to manage the mold removal yourself, make sure to wear appropriate protective equipment. The CDC suggests that you wear long trousers and a long-sleeve t-shirt, protective gloves and glasses, waterproof boots, and a mask rated a minimum of N-95 or more to safeguard your nose and mouth. Note that while these masks safeguard you from small particles like mold, they are not appropriate if you are coming across any sort of gases, chemical vapors, asbestos or lead.</p>
<p>Cleaning of all afflicted surfaces starts next. Antifungal and antimicrobial cleansers are used on any hard surface areas to remove the mold from the surface area. If anything can be removed, such as furnishings, clothing, or toys, these are usually brought offsite for cleaning to ensure all mold spores are eradicated, typically involving deep cleaning with an antimicrobial or antifungal cleanser.</p>

<p>A DIY mold remediation product that mold professionals normally advise is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of warm water. Use the option on the surface affected by mold and scrub the location with a rug or brush till the mold vanishes. Due to the fact that borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no need to wash it off. However, do not utilize this cleaner on porous surfaces like drywall.

<p>Fire is the outcome of a chain reaction in between the oxygen that is present in the environment and a source of combustible fuel. Once this flammable fuel - drywall, furniture, or carpet - has been warmed to its special ignition temperature level, the fuel will catch fire and unstable gases will be launched in the kind of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves behind can trigger long lasting damage and should be dealt with by skilled experts, heat is the most obvious, and destructive, product of this chain reaction.

<p>When your house floods, the water can ruin the structure of your house, your personal belongings, and the health of the inside environment. Flood waters consist of lots of pollutants and great deals of mud.

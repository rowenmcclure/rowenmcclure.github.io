<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven ineffective against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually facilitates mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Water damage develops from damaged pipelines, obstructed drains, malfunctioning devices, storms, fire damage, and other causes. The proper treatment depends on the nature of the damage. Some water carries contaminants and should be considered harmful.

<h3>Smoke Clean Up Service in Blythewood</h3>
<p>Eliminate plaster, wallboard and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge.

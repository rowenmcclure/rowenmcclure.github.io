<p>The Epa (EPA) recommends discarding materials that have not been thoroughly cleaned and dried within 2 days of water damage. Repair any leaks or underlying problems right now to help prevent mold development or its return. Mold exists naturally in the air inside and outside of your home. For that reason, it is not possible to totally remove" all of the mold from within a building, as tiny spores will still exist even after the issue has been addressed.<p>
<p>Eliminating among the 3 requirements for mold decreases (or gets rid of) new mold development: moisture; food for the mold spores (for instance, dust or dander ); and heat considering that mold generally does not grow in cold environments. I had a terrific experience working with the team at Northwest Water and Fire Restoration. They were professional, extremely communicative and prompt! I would certainly advise for any mitigation or restoration work you need.<p>

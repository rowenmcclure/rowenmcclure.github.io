<p>Since common building products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically connected to water or wetness exposure and may be triggered by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can result in interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.

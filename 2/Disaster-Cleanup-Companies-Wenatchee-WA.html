<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, drifting through the air up until they land someplace. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the very same way, so if the location the spores land is moist and good, mold can begin to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a huge issue on your hands.</p>
<p>Getting it damp can turn into a major headache since the gypsum drywall is permeable and soluble in water. Wet drywall will soak up water and grow heavy to manage from screw or nails that hold it in location. In the case where drywall does get damp and simply starts to droop prior to drying, repairing it might just need pressing it back into location, securing it with some brand-new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>

Try to find signs of wetness or water damage (water leaks, standing water, water spots, condensation, etc.).</p>
<p>According to Lstiburek, the response was simple: It was a perfect storm"-- a mix that lawyers now declare originated from pressure to develop much faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost structure products, and little federal government and contractor oversight.

Experts have identified Pennsylvania the epicenter of an industrywide epidemic that has actually impacted sprawling suburban houses, starter homes, and luxury Philadelphia townhouses alike. Characteristics built with products other than stucco had problems, too. Some houses with water damage were constructed by billion-dollar public companies. Others, by little, local companies. Some are 10 or twenty years old. Others are brand-new.</p>
<p>Since typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is normally connected to water or wetness exposure and might be triggered by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can cause interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor travels through ceilings and walls, usually condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

<p>Instead, it was not till late 2016 that Goldstein started to hear whispers about water damage and see scaffolding rise. By that time, his home was more than 14 years old. He was out of luck. Seeing your home and valuable possessions taken in by fire can be among the most severe losses that a homeowner can experience. After such a destructive loss, peace of mind originates from having clear guidance and assistance in restoring as much as possible from fire and smoke damage.<p>
<p>It's a stressful situation when water floods your floorings, soaks into your walls, and damages your furnishings. Considering that a carpet cleaner can just do so much, you require a water damage cleanup team that does it all. Desiccants (silica gel, clay, calcium oxide) soak up moisture like a sponge. Place water-permeable plans of desiccants and wet products in airtight containers or in sealed areas, like closets. Some desiccants change color to indicate they are filled, which can take days or weeks, depending on just how much moisture items consist of.<p>

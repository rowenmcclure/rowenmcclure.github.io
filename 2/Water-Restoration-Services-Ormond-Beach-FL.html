Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was already full, however when he found out how much water bill I was paying because the leak began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the location of the leakage for me and after that even assisted me shut down my primary water valve. Easy-going and really courteous individual.</p>

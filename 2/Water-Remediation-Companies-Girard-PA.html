Wear rubber gloves. Make sure to rinse surface areas with clear warm water and dry completely.

<p>We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen after we found our faucet was dripping. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and hauled away whatever else.  We were really pleased that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they returned the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got so much done in one day!  Someone has actually come out each day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and abilities to get the job done correctly. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>

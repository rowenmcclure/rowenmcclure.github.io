<p>As wetness is released in the air, nature constantly attempts to reach stability. Computing the dew point is important in drying because when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surface areas. The dew point constantly occurs at 100% relative humidity (RH). The dew point is the temperature the air requires to be cooled to, at continuous pressure, in order to attain an RH if 100%. At this moment the air can not hold more water in gas form. Water vapor would have to come out of the environment in a liquid kind if the air were to be cooled even more. The higher the dew point increases, the greater the amount of wetness in the air.</p>

<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart supplies us with the tools to evaluate which drying equipment or methods will be the most effective. It is imperative to determine if conditions are achievable within the drying chamber based on the outdoors temperature and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating unit. These conditions can assist in determining what equipment to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, hidden and sensible energy, can be computed by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Assessment Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula precisely anticipates the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to numerous building materials and how they respond to each one and offer the best evaporation results. The greater the number, the faster products will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more handy if the outside grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>

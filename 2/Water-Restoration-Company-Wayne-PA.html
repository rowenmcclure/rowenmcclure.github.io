They returned every day (frequently twice a day) to keep track of and change the dehumidifiers and fans to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained whatever they were doing along the way and also were very useful in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the expenses and I 'd advise them without doubt.</p>

Below seemingly unblemished exteriors made from various materials-- brick, stucco, vinyl siding, stone, fiber cement board, and more-- water has damaged whatever from window sills to insulation that once puffed like pink fairy floss. In many cases, wooden sheathing is so saturated that it now flakes easily, crumbling into mulch-like chips. Mold, termites, and phorid flies have plagued some walls.</p>

Spores can survive conditions that are too sunny, hot, cold, dry or damp for mold to grow. When spores are released, they can be carried by air or water to new locations.</p>

Never utilize soot cleaner or water before you use a dry-cleaning sponge, or you could spread out the soot and make it difficult to get rid of with a chemical sponge.

When all sides are stained, trim the sides with a knife to reveal fresh surface areas below. Or merely grab a new sponge. Make certain you use a wiping motion the entire time.

Never utilize soot cleaner or water before you use a dry-cleaning sponge, or you could spread out the soot and make it difficult to get rid of with a chemical sponge.

When all sides are stained, trim the sides with a knife to reveal fresh surface areas below. Or merely grab a new sponge. Make certain you use a wiping motion the entire time.

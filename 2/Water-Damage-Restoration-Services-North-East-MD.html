There is no trusted timetable for this procedure to happen; a MacBook's internal elements generally begin rusting immediately after the spill, however sometimes your Mac can function generally for days or weeks without showing any apparent sign of a problem. How quickly the corrosion procedure takes depends on a ton of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and how long the device remained in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or utilize the MacBook at all until you can attend to the damage. Below are a few examples of deterioration caused by a water spill.</p>

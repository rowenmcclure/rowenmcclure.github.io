<p>Flooding of a private sewer system can be a harmful circumstance for house owners, according to Plumbing 2.0's seasoned pipes experts in Mesa, Arizona It may result in a back-up of sewage in the home, contaminated drinking water and absence of sanitation up until the system is fixed. When flooding or saturated soil conditions continue, a personal sewage system can not work effectively (common pipes problems in old houses ). Soil treatment systems for wastewater rely on aerobic (with oxygen) areas to lower the amounts of chemicals and living organisms (viruses, bacteria and protozoa). When the soil is filled or flooded, those dangerous materials can get in the groundwater and your drinking supply of water.</p>
<p>It's not unusual in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to eliminate up to 18 inches of drywall due to the fact that mold and mildew can be a major health risk. However, FEMA advises that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material need to be eliminated to a height of 4 feet. As drywall is available in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it much easier to replace the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material need to be eliminated to a height of 8 feet or approximately the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>
<p>When the next water damage call comes in for a flood cleanup due to a damaged water pipe or drain backup, make sure you have all the commercial restoration devices on hand that you need to take on the job in a minute's notice.

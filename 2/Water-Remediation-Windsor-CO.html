<p>Water invasion into structures can be exceptionally destructive. We engaged a team of scientists at the University of Colorado once InstaScope was created.

<p>When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. Eliminate paneling, wallboard and plaster to at least the flood level. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be a permanent health danger and should be removed. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the suggestion of the blade and watch out for pipes, duct work and electrical wiring.</p>

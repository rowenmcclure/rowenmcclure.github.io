<p>If you were lucky sufficient to be in Aircraft Mode when you dropped the device, however, or are otherwise positive that nothing will happen to make your iPhone wake up in the next 2 days, leaving it alone may be the better choice. A leaking warm water heating unit is normally economical to repair, however the repercussions of not making repairs can install rapidly.

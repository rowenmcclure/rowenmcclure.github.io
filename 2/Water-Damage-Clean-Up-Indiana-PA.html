<p>We called them out to examine water damage in our cooking area after we found our faucet was dripping. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and hauled away everything else.  We were really delighted that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I could not think they got a lot done in one day!  Somebody has actually come out each day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and abilities to do the job effectively. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>Mold needs nutrients, water, oxygen and beneficial temperature levels to grow. Nutrients for mold are present in dead natural material such as wood, paper or materials; mold can also derive nutrients from some synthetic products such as adhesives and paints. Mold requires wetness, although some mold species can get that wetness from wet air when the relative humidity is above 70 percent. Carefully pry baseboards far from walls so that you can inspect sheetrock at floor level. The porous material can quickly absorb flood water, and you need to know the level of potential damage.<p>

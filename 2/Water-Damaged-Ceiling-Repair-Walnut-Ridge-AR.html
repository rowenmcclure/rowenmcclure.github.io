<p>When standing water is gotten rid of, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has soaked up (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) get rid of the moisture in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking process consists of inspecting ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly based on temperature level as well, so cooling a room down with outside air can also set a drying job back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service professionals before you make any changes.</p>

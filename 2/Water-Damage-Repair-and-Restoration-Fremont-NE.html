<p>Due to the fact that typical building materials can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically associated with water or wetness exposure and may be triggered by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor travels through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>

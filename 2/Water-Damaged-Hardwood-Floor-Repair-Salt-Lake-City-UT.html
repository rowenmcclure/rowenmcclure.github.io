When MacBook water damage has happened, the liquid will likely make its way to the reasoning board and other elements.

If there is a source of power offered, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. You will likely end up with an extremely pricey paperweight if this deterioration process is not stopped.</p>

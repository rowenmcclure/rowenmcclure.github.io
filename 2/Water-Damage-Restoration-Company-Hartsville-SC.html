<p>Fire Damage is the most terrible sort of home damage that a family or company can experience. Once MacBook water damage has happened, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other components. The liquid's minerals and salts immediately start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements. Typically, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then quit working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually rusting. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process. This triggers the copper and other metals to move across the board. If this corrosion procedure is not stopped, you will likely end up with an extremely costly paperweight.</p>

<p>If smoke and fire damage has actually affected your valuables, we will work with you and your insurance provider to determine what can be brought back, and what will be an insurance replacement claim. For items that can be restored, we utilize ultrasonic cleaning to restore your damaged belongings. For this, we used Zinsser's Water Based Peel-Stop What this does is imitate a glue which permeates into porous surface, avoiding water from leaking back through. Basically, it makes the area strong again and secures the surface area from future water damage. After you have applied the Peel-Stop, enable an hour of drying time.<p>

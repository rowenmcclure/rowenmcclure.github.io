And naturally, basements can be vulnerable to flooding, due to severe weather condition or undiscovered leakages in the pipelines or sump pump. In addition, once mold establishes, concrete block or concrete walls can be challenging to clean due to their rough texture.</p>
<p>Mold spores are discovered nearly all over, both inside and out. If water or very high levels 1 of humidity are present in your house, mold growth can begin in as low as 48 hours.

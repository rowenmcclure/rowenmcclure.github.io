<p>As soon as standing water is gotten rid of, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually absorbed (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) get rid of the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure consists of checking ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily based on temperature level also, so cooling a space down with outside air can likewise set a drying job back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service professionals prior to you make any modifications if you have questions on this.</p>
<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we equip the residential or commercial property with air scrubbers. We typically will set one unit for every single two to three rooms, depending on the size of the room. These units have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the intake where it travels through three filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and certified to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which suggests that they remove at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned up and much of the odor removed. This process goes on for days. As you can envision, over the course of numerous days, the air that can be found in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and deodorizing treatments.</p>

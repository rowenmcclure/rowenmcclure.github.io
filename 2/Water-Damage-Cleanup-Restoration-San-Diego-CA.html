<h2>Steps to Preventing Water Damage in San Diego</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you might not know is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven inefficient against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>When decontaminating a crawl area or attic, we initially check for any security dangers, following OSHA and COIT rules for restricted area entry. We then draw out standing water utilizing our truck-mounted extraction equipment. If your insulation has been impacted, we will remove the damaged insulation, bag it up, and securely dispose of it. If they have been damaged, we will also inspect vapor barriers (a sheet or finish that prevents water vapor from penetrating walls) and remove them.</p>

<h3>Fire Damage Claims in San Diego - Tips for Filing an Insurance Claim</h3>
<p>After getting rid of the damaged drywall, determine the size of the hole so you can eliminate a patch from a new sheet of drywall. Location 4 drywall clips around the hole.

Eliminate the spot and insert it, then protect it to the drywall clips (and available ceiling joists) using drywall screws. Beware not to over-tighten.<p>

We make it our mission to check your home from leading to bottom to make sure that all excess water and wetness is eliminated when you need emergency water removal.

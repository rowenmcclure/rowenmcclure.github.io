<p>Current Evaluation: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility told me if it's going at the present rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he learnt how much water expense I was paying considering that the leakage began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the location of the leakage for me and then even helped me closed down my main water valve. Very polite and easy-going individual.</p>

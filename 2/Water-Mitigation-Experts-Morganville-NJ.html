<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. As mentioned, fast air motion throughout wet surfaces of products or assemblies is a critical element of successfully and efficiently drying the surface area of those products and assemblies. Conditions favorable to drying at the surface differ from moving excess moisture within the assemblies or materials. Rapid air movement across the surface of material becomes less important relative to vapor pressure as the focus of removing surface wetness gives way to reducing moisture content in low evaporation materials. The continuous and falling rates of drying products need various criteria for altering conditions.</p>
<p>Step 5: Restoration - The biggest step in the process is restoration. Restoration includes changing materials like drywall and insulation. Sometimes this process is as easy as setting up a few panels of drywall, while serious cases could require replacing entire walls. Direct exposure to poisonous substances like lead and asbestos is possible during restoration. Older houses are most likely to consist of these substances.</p>

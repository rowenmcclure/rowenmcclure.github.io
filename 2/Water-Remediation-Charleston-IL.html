<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Over time, roofs may develop dark streaks. It might be dirt that can be just power-washed off, or it may be mold. You shouldn't have anything growing, or even creating an inviting environment, for critters, bugs, or birds. It's going to begin to use and degrade much faster if the flora and animals of your area decides to settle in on your roofing system. If you see your roofing looking in need of some attention, talk with an expert specialist.</p>
<p>Getting it wet can turn into a significant headache because the plaster drywall is soluble and porous in water. Wet drywall will absorb water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in location. In the case where drywall does get damp and simply starts to droop before drying out, repairing it might simply require pushing it back into location, protecting it with some new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>

<p>Any building that has experienced water damage or issues with excess moisture is at risk of mold growth. Erosion to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to prolonged water direct exposure and requires masonry work to repair. Irreversible staining on floors and walls is another possible impact of water damage. Walls and floor covering might require replacement or refinishing depending upon the extent of damage. Musty odors can remain in a home where leakages or flooding have actually taken place and this could be indicative of excess mold and mildew development.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that common structure products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is normally related to water or moisture direct exposure and might be triggered by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor travels through walls and ceilings, normally condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

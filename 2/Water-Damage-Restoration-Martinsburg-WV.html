<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is in fact made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot compound that can damage the surface areas it touches, simply as fire does. Lots of people think that since smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it just goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this implies that the smoke will spread, damaging a much larger location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration techniques will involve searching a wide location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>

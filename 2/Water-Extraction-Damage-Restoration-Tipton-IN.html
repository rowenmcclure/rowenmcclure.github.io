<p>Mold - the look, the odor, even the thought of it makes you recoil. You probably have visions of long-forgotten takeout food crammed in the back of your fridge, or an old shabby tub that hasn't been utilized in years. But aside from what might be growing in your refrigerator, household mold is actually extremely common, and can represent a significant health threat if left unattended. After eliminating all polluted and wet products, contact somebody who can examine your home and start the restoration procedure.<p>
<p>Tea tree oil is typically used to keep spiders away, however it's also one of the safer alternatives for eliminating black mold. It's a natural fungicide that can work as a cleaning product, and it has the strength to avoid mold spores from coming back. Mold professionals generally discard musty permeable building products such as drywall, insulation and baseboards. These products are fairly inexpensive to replace and difficult to impossible to restore to their previous unpolluted condition.<p>

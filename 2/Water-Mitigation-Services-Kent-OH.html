<p>Because typical structure products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is normally connected to water or wetness direct exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, generally condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.

After the problem has actually been corrected, the property then needs to be thoroughly dried, eliminating all traces of wetness.</p>
<p>Mold is virtually all over, drifting in the air and on all surface areas. Individuals are exposed to molds 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year. Direct exposures increase when indoor moldy products becomes dried, damaged or disturbed, causing spores and other mold cells to be released into the air and after that inhaled.

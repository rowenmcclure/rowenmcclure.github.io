As soon as MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its method to the reasoning board and other elements. The liquid's minerals and salts right away start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts. Frequently, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then stop working.

If there is a power source readily available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will interact with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process.

Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was already complete, however when he found out just how much water expense I was paying given that the leakage began, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the location & found of the leak for me and after that even helped me shut down my main water valve. Extremely respectful and easy-going person.</p>

<h3>Tips To Restoration And Clean-Up After Smoke And Fire Damage in Park Rapids</h3>
<p>Remove paneling, wallboard and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a long-term health risk and should be eliminated if soaked by polluted floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the tip of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
<p>Fire can cause large amounts of damage on your residential or commercial property. However, there are other damages that can seriously affect the structure too. Smoke smell gets into structure materials and individual belongings of every kind. Smoke soot damages walls that have not been burned by flames. Experiencing a fire can be ravaging, and Paul Davis understands that your cherished ownerships and memories are at stake. As fire restoration experts, we specialize in soot and smoke damage too.<p>

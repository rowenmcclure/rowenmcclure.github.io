These filters are tested and accredited to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which implies that they eliminate at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has actually been cleaned and much of the odor removed. This process goes on for days. As you can envision, throughout several days, the air that comes in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and ventilating procedures.</p>

<h3>The Role Of Professionals In Smoke Damage Cleanup in Ripon</h3>
<p>Eliminate paneling, plaster and wallboard to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. It can be a permanent health threat and must be eliminated if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney impact" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize only the pointer of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>

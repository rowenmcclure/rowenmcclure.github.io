They returned every day (typically two times a day) to keep an eye on and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained whatever they were doing along the way and also were extremely useful in collaborating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster.

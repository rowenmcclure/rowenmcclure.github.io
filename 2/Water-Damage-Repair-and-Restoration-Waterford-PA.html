<p>When you are planning large repair work, bear in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By lowering the thickness here, it's easier to hide long taped seams under several coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, ended up appearance, it's important to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise keep in mind that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even when the job is finished.<p>

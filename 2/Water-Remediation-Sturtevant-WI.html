<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing large repairs. By decreasing the thickness here, it's much easier to conceal long taped seams under several coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed look, it is necessary to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise keep in mind that considering that wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This assists strengthen the strength of the wall and assists separate vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more visible even when the job is ended up.<p>

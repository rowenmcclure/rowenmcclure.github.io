<h3>Tips To Restoration And Clean-Up After Smoke And Fire Damage in Lebanon</h3>
<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation product that mold specialists normally advise is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of warm water. Apply the option on the surface area impacted by mold and scrub the area with a carpet or brush until the mold disappears. There's no need to rinse it off because borax will keep the mold from coming back. Nevertheless, do not use this cleaner on permeable surface areas like drywall. Such materials soak up water quickly. This might worsen the problem due to the fact that as you understand - mold loves wet environments.<p>

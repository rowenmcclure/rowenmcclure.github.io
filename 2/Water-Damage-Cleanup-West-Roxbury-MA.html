<p>As soon as standing water is removed, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has absorbed (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) get rid of the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers.

Part of our tracking procedure consists of checking ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature level too, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can also set a drying project back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service specialists before you make any changes if you have concerns on this.</p>

<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, drifting through the air until they land somewhere. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the same way, so if the location the spores land is wet and great, mold can begin to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a big problem on your hands.</p>

<p>Class 3 - biggest amount of water, absorption, and evaporation. Water intrusion where wet, permeable products (e.g., carpet, plaster board, fiber-fill insulation, concrete masonry system (CMU), textiles) represent more than ~ 40% of the combined floor, wall, and ceiling area in the space; and where materials described as low evaporation products (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, fitness center floors, or other complex, built-up assemblies) have taken in very little moisture.</p>
<p>Additional Services Offered: The majority of contractors see the requirement to add or offer additional services. After a long time in the business, you're missing out on extra dollars to subcontractors.

<p>Some air cleaners are created to produce ozone which is a strong oxidizing agent and a known irritant of the lungs and breathing system. Research studies have actually revealed that ozone, even at high concentrations, is ineffective at killing air-borne mold or surface mold contamination. Even if mold was killed by ozone, the health hazards would not be decreased up until mold impurities are removed through cleaning. Health experts, consisting of the Minnesota Department of Health, do not recommend the use of ozone to address mold or any other indoor air problems.</p>

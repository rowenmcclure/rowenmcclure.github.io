<p>We will do our best to restore your contents to a pre-loss condition. Some items, when exposed to water for a time period, end up being permanently damaged (i.e. they will never ever be the exact same).

Another point is, there are various levels of contamination with water (see Classifications of Water), which will factor into the formula of what can be conserved and what should be changed.

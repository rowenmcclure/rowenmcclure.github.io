<p>Current Review: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility told me if it's going at the present rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he learnt just how much water bill I was paying given that the leakage began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He marked the place & discovered of the leak for me and after that even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Easy-going and extremely respectful person.</p>

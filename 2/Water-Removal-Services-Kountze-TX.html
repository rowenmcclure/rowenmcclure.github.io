<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your home or organisation is one of the most devastating things that can happen to a household or a person. To begin resolving a water damaged wall or ceiling in your house, you should determine the source of the water.

Standard home fans are not efficient in moving an adequate amount of air needed to dry a room effectively.</p>

<p>Unfavorable air makers, equipped with HEPA (high effectiveness particulate air filters") should be made use of to get rid of germs and other pollutants from the air during restoration work. Standing water and bulk sewage should be drawn out with self-contained vacuum equipment with appropriate waste holding tanks which need to be disposed of appropriately. Difficult surface areas that are affected should be cleaned up and sanitized. Soft structural materials such as carpeting, rug, plaster wallboard should be gotten rid of and appropriately disposed of. Any material that soaks up significant amounts of moisture and can not be sufficiently cleaned up should be removed. When polluted products have been gotten rid of, a 2nd application of sanitizers must be used to all work surface areas.</p>

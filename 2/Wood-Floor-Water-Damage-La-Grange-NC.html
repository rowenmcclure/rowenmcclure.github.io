<p>Eliminate paneling, plaster and wallboard to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. It can be a long-term health danger and must be removed if soaked by contaminated floodwater.

This creates a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize only the tip of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>

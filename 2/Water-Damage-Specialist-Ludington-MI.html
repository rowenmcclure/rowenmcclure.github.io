<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in products that have become infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming airborne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being airborne.</p>

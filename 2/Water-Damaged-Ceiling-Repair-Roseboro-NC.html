Constantly ensure the interior of the wall is dry before you seal it, or mold and mildew may become a problem later on.<p>
<p>Current Review: We called them out to examine water damage in our cooking area after we found our faucet was dripping. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen for us in our living room and transported away everything else.  We were extremely pleased that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I could not think they got so much performed in one day!  Someone has come out each day to sign in and I feel confident in their understanding and capabilities to do the job effectively. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>

<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is actually made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Lots of people think that because smoke rises into the air, diffusion takes place, and it merely goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this means that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much larger location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration techniques will include searching a large location to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>

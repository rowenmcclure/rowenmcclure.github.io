<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. As pointed out, quick air movement throughout damp surface areas of products or assemblies is a vital component of efficiently and effectively drying the surface area of those materials and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface vary from moving excess moisture within the materials or assemblies. Fast air motion across the surface of material becomes lesser relative to vapor pressure as the focus of eliminating surface area wetness gives way to decreasing moisture material in low evaporation materials. The constant and falling rates of drying materials need different requirements for changing conditions.</p>
<p>Daily moisture readings need to be included in the drying record to consist of a/c, air, and equipment systems. Moisture content levels for damp structural materials should be taped in a wetness material spreadsheet to reveal the development of drying These recorded moisture material readings will show that the structure is back to an appropriate series of pre-loss condition. It is important to understand that air records alone will not prove that a building is dry. After 24 hours the psychrometric conditions will demonstrate if sufficient dehumidification is being utilized or if modifications are needed.</p>

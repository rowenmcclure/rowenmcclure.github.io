<p>Getting it damp can turn into a significant headache since the gypsum drywall is soluble and permeable in water. Wet drywall will soak up water and grow heavy to manage from screw or nails that hold it in location. In the case where drywall does get damp and just begins to droop prior to drying, fixing it might simply need pressing it back into location, protecting it with some brand-new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>

<p>As wetness is released in the air, nature constantly attempts to reach balance. Calculating the dew point is important in drying due to the fact that when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surfaces. The humidity constantly occurs at 100% relative humidity (RH). The dew point is the temperature the air needs to be cooled to, at consistent pressure, in order to achieve an RH if 100%. At this moment the air can not hold more water in gas type. If the air were to be cooled much more, water vapor would have to come out of the atmosphere in a liquid type. The higher the dew point rises, the higher the amount of wetness in the air.</p>
<p>More involved screening might include sending out samples to a screening facility, or taking samples of the air to check if there is no visible mold, but mold is suspected.

<p>Fire Damage is the most terrible sort of residential or commercial property damage that a household or business can experience. Once MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other components. The liquid's minerals and salts instantly begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Often, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and after that stop working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually corroding. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. If this corrosion procedure is not stopped, you will likely wind up with a very pricey paperweight.</p>

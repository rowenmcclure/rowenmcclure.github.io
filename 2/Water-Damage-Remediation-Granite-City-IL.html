<p>Mold can cause severe health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown inefficient against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Mold growths (nests) can develop within 24-48 hours, so it is important to act instantly if you have a water spill or leakage-- specifically if you live in a hot or damp  environment. If you are past the point of DIY and require professional help, mold remediation teams will concern your area, evaluate the level of the mold issue, determine and correct all water leaks and sources of wetness, identify all mold sources (both noticeable and hidden), use specialized devices to consist of and avoid migration of mold spores, safely eliminate infected products, deal with plagued areas with approved antimicrobial sprays, dehumidify and dry the appropriate areas, and seal areas as needed.</p>

<p>Smoke damage is a common adverse effects of fire damage, but it can occur by itself if a fire is included. Desiccant dehumidifiers - This type of dehumidifier produces the lowest humidity ratio. Desiccant dehumidifiers take in wetness through chemical tourist attraction instead of condensation to get rid of water from the air. A desiccant is a material that draws in and holds wetness. This material acts like a sponge drawing moisture from the air (sorption). When the wheel rotates through heated up exhaust air, the wetness vaporizes (desorption) and is brought outdoors. Then the cycle repeats.</p>
<p>When decontaminating a crawl area or attic, we initially look for any security threats, following OSHA and COIT rules for confined area entry. We then extract standing water using our truck-mounted extraction devices. If your insulation has been impacted, we will get rid of the damaged insulation, bag it up, and securely get rid of it. We will also check vapor barriers (a sheet or covering that avoids water vapor from penetrating walls) and eliminate them if they have actually been damaged.</p>

<p>Since typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is typically related to water or moisture direct exposure and might be brought on by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor passes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.

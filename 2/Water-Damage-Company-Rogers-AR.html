Depending on the damage the hardwood floor may be fixed instead of being completely changed. Then the bulk of the floor can be conserved and a separated floorboard may need repairing, if there is minor damage. However, if the damage is significant then the whole floor might require changing and sometimes even the subfloor as well. The kind of wood flooring you might have identifies and restricts the type of repair work that need to occur. Strong hardwood floor covering enables a broader variety of alternatives to fix the issue. With solid hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away as much as a quarter of an inch off the wood to get rid of water damage on the surface area. This kind of floor covering can also have replacements for individual slabs. The very best way to look after a water damaged location on your wood floor is to replace the affected boards and then refinish the entire floor to bring it back to a unifying look.</p>

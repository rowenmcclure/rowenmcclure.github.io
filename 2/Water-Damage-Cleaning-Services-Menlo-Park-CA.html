<p>Knowing how to figure out precisely what is damp throughout a water loss is a critical part of the job. If locations of wetness are overlooked, bacteria and molds can grow.

<p>The air to be dried, or processed, is ducted through the rotor in one air stream. The rotor brings the wet desiccant to the reactivation jet stream to heat it up.

This process takes in wetness without ice build-up and is not restricted by low temperature levels. Desiccants can quickly run below freezing temperatures.</p>
<p>BRAVO - job well done! Discovered a flood at home in San Francisco - water had actually been over streaming a second floor sink for 15 hours.

Drying fans were set up, heating pads were put on hardwood walls, ceilings and floors were opened and drying and dehumidifying tubes installed. Excellent, expert care. Very pleased with their quick shipment of emergency service AND their attention to information to guarantee the water damage was dried out totally.</p>

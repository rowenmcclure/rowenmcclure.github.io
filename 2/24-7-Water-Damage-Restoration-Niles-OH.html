<h3>Fire Restoration Cleaning in Niles</h3>
<p>Remove plaster, wallboard and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a long-term health risk and must be gotten rid of. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the suggestion of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>

The CDC recommends that you use long pants and a long-sleeve t-shirt, protective gloves and glasses, waterproof boots, and a mask rated at least N-95 or more to safeguard your nose and mouth. Keep in mind that while these masks secure you from little particles like mold, they are not sufficient if you are experiencing any sort of gases, chemical vapors, asbestos or lead.</p>

We then extract standing water using our truck-mounted extraction equipment. If your insulation has actually been impacted, we will get rid of the damaged insulation, bag it up, and securely dispose of it. We will also inspect vapor barriers (a sheet or finishing that avoids water vapor from permeating walls) and remove them if they have been damaged.</p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: We called them out to examine water damage in our kitchen area after we found our faucet was leaking. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and transported away everything else.  We were really pleased that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they came back the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got a lot done in one day!  Somebody has come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their understanding and abilities to get the job done effectively.

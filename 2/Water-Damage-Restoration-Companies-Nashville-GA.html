<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart offers us with the tools to evaluate which drying devices or methods will be the most reliable. It is vital to determine if conditions are attainable within the drying chamber based on the outside temperature and particular humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system. These conditions can assist in identifying what devices to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, hidden and sensible energy, can be determined by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Evaluation Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula accurately anticipates the energy evaluation of ambient air and its relationship to multiple structure materials and how they respond to each one and provide the best evaporation results. The higher the number, the faster products will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more handy if the outdoors grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>

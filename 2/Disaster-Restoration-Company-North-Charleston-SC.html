They fasted to get to your home and began drying our drenched crawlspace instantly. They returned every day (frequently twice a day) to keep track of and change the dehumidifiers and fans to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists.

<p>Negative air devices, equipped with HEPA (high effectiveness particle air filters") must be utilized to eliminate bacteria and other impurities from the air throughout restoration work.

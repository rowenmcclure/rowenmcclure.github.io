<p>Daily moisture readings must be included in the drying record to include heating and cooling, air, and devices systems. Moisture material levels for wet structural products need to be tape-recorded in a wetness material spreadsheet to reveal the progress of drying These recorded wetness material readings will reveal that the building is back to an acceptable series of pre-loss condition. It is very important to know that air records alone will not show that a building is dry. After 24 hours the psychrometric conditions will show if sufficient dehumidification is being used or if modifications are required.</p>
<h3>Insurance Claim Water Damage in Marion Virginia</h2>
<p>HVAC: Heater and air conditioning system units can end up being flooded, which can damage their internal electrical systems and splash pilot lights. They can likewise end up being muddy, and cleaning them will require expert cleaning. In addition, venting systems can flood and end up being contaminated. They must be taken apart and hosed off piece by piece to prevent contamination from being blown through the air if that occurs.</p>
<p>Lastly, we want to deal with the use of bleach on mold. Using bleach on visible mold development is NOT recommended by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Standard for Expert Mold Remediation. First, bleach is a chemical and can impact individuals with chemical sensitivities particularly if used in areas that are not well aerated. Second, on non-porous surfaces such as tile, bleach disappears effective at eliminating mold than a damp fabric and a moderate cleaning agent, so we advise the least harmful alternative.</p>
<p>We will do our best to restore your contents to a pre-loss condition. Some products, when exposed to water for a time period, become permanently damaged (i.e. they will never be the exact same). Other items may merely require to be decontaminated and transferred to high ground. Soft products like clothes, bedspreads, drapes can be sent out to a laundry service that we can arrange for you. Another point is, there are different levels of contamination with water (see Categories of Water), and that will factor into the equation of what can be conserved and what need to be replaced. We will work with you throughout the loss, setting aside products that we feel can not be effectively brought back so you can make a list to turn into your insurance adjuster. Your Adjuster will then figure out a compensation for your items according to the terms of your policy.</p>

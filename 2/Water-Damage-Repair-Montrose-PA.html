<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Water damage, water invasion, building envelope problems, and building and construction flaws are a really serious matter. Here in Portland, Oregon, Vancouver, Washington and the surrounding areas are experiencing countless problems due to leaking doors and windows, water and wind driven rain damage. Senior living facilities, houses, condos, townhomes, hotels, commercial buildings are particularly susceptible to these concerns as typically the builder subcontracts the exterior envelope work and wall assembly process, therefore leading to corners and expenses being cut.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become wet or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in materials that have ended up being infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming airborne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become air-borne.</p>

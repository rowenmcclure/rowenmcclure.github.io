<p>Whether it happens in your ceiling due to the fact that of a leaky roofing, condensation from your central air, or flooding, fixing water-damaged drywall can cause you anxiety and stress, especially if you have actually never ever done it in the past.

The best way to prevent mold development is to get rid of water leakages or moisture in your house. See our article, How Do I Prevent Mold Growth?" for mold prevention tips.</p>
<p>Another downside of bleach is that it can damage the materials it's used on as it is a severe, corrosive chemical.

For these factors try to avoid utilizing bleach and if you need to utilize it, just use it on non-porous surface areas.</p>

This is due to the metals oxidizing and slowly rusting. If there is a source of power available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this rust procedure. This causes the copper and other metals to move across the board. You will likely end up with an extremely expensive paperweight if this deterioration procedure is not stopped.</p>

<p>Since common structure materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is normally connected to water or moisture exposure and might be triggered by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can result in interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

<p>Since common building materials can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally connected to water or wetness direct exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, normally condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.

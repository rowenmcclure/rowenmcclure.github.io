<p>When you're getting rid of the damaged area, it's a good concept to cut it out as a rectangular shape or square While this typically increases the amount of area you require to replace, this makes it much easier to cut and fit patches. It also makes the taping and mudding work simpler to mix in with the rest of the area. For ceilings, patches that are 12 square inches or less can be kept in place with drywall clips.

At this moment the air can not hold more water in gas form. If the air were to be cooled even more, water vapor would need to come out of the atmosphere in a liquid form.

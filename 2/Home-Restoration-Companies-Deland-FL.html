<h3>Water & Fire Damage Restoration in Deland</h3>
<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing big repair work. By decreasing the density here, it's much easier to hide long taped joints under a number of coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished look, it's important to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also bear in mind that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the task is finished, this helps reinforce the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more visible even.<p>

<h3>Fire Damage Claims in Dripping Springs - Tips for Filing an Insurance Claim</h3>
<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation item that mold professionals typically suggest is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry area. To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of warm water. Use the solution on the surface impacted by mold and scrub the location with a carpet or brush until the mold disappears. There's no requirement to wash it off because borax will keep the mold from returning. However, do not use this cleaner on porous surfaces like drywall. Such materials absorb water quickly. This could worsen the issue due to the fact that as you know - mold likes moist environments.<p>

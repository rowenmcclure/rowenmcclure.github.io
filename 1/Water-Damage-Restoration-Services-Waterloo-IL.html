<p>While the iPhone 7 and later are waterproof, it does not stop water from entering into the speaker grille. The Apple Watch Series 2 and later have a similar concern, although they come with a built-in feature that can be toggled to 'eject' the water by playing a particular frequency. The worst problem with mold is that it has the potential to cause health effects. Mold can trigger allergic reactions and even asthma attacks, as some people are allergic to mold. As mold requires water to grow it is necessary to prevent moisture and humidity issues in buildings, particularly ones affected by water.<p>

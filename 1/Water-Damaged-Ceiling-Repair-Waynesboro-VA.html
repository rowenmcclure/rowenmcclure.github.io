<p>When left alone, mold can trigger severe health issues through airborne pathogens. What you may not understand is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven inefficient versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Mix one part 3% hydrogen peroxide with 2 parts water and in a spray bottle. If you really wish to prevent buying a spray bottle (although seriously, get the bottle!), you can also soak a towel in this option and wipe it directly over mold growth. Let the option sit for approximately 10 minutes, and after that scrub the location with a small brush or tooth brush. Wipe any remaining mold away with a towel and let the area dry.</p>

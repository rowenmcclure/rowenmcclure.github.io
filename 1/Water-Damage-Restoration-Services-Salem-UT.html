<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you might not know is that most chemicals, including bleach, have been proven ineffective versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact assists in mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>

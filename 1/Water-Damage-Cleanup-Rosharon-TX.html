<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health issues through air-borne pathogens. Experts have actually identified Pennsylvania the center of an industrywide epidemic that has impacted stretching rural homes, starter homes, and high-end Philadelphia townhouses alike. Residences built with products other than stucco had problems, too. Some homes with water damage were built by billion-dollar public companies. Others, by small, local companies. Some are 10 or 20 years old. Others are brand-new.</p>
<p>Because typical structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is normally related to water or moisture direct exposure and may be caused by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, generally condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

Much like axial fans, centrifugal fans move air across wet surfaces, evaporating moisture into the air. With using warm air from the centrifugal, the water vapor is taken in by the dehumidifier. In addition to axial fans, a sufficient number of centrifugal fans are preferred.</p>
<p>Once standing water is removed, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually taken in (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the impacted rooms) and b) get rid of the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking process includes inspecting ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly depending on temperature level also, so cooling a space down with outside air can also set a drying job back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service technicians prior to you make any changes.</p>

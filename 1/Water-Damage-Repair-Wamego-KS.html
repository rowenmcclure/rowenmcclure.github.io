<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, floating through the air up until they land someplace. Think of planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the very same way, so if the location the spores land is excellent and damp, mold can begin to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a big issue on your hands.</p>

<p>Jake (and his team) are amazing to work with. They fasted to react initially and supplied a reasonable and fair quote. They had the ability to fit us into their schedule quickly and get the work done very quickly. Our mold issue wound up being smaller sized than very first thought so the last invoice showed the actual work required and was less than very first priced estimate. Jake was extremely responsive to calls and e-mails responding to concerns throughout the procedure. All in all, I had a great experience with Jake and Carolina Water Damage Restoration.</p>
<p>BRAVO - job well done! Found a flood at home in San Francisco - water had actually been over flowing a 2nd floor sink for 15 hours. Contacted Allied, signed work order on line and employees were at the house within 15 minutes. They brought a truck load of equipment to mitigate the damage. Drying fans were set up, heating pads were placed on hardwood floors, ceilings and walls were opened and drying and dehumidifying tubes installed. Exceptional, expert care. Really pleased with their quick shipment of emergency service AND their attention to information to make sure the water damage was dried out completely.</p>

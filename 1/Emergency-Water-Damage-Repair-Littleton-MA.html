<h3>Fire Damage Restoration in Littleton</h3>
<p>Get rid of paneling, plaster and wallboard to at least the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when wet. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a long-term health hazard and should be removed. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the idea of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>

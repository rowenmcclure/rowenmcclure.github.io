<p>Prior to you clean the house, you must wear proper protection. Smoke, particles and soot can be harmful to inhale, so wear a respirator if there is substantial soot in the damaged location. Use long sleeves and trousers to protect your skin. You should also wear gloves and eye security. Considering that you will be releasing soot as you clean, it's important to set floor defense and get rid of any furniture or household items that are not damaged. You can most likely get away with merely covering furnishings with plastic or sheets if the damaged location is little. However if you're cleaning a whole space, it's a good idea to eliminate those clean items and even seal off other rooms that are intact. Bear in mind the shoes you're using so you don't track soot spots into other spaces.<p>

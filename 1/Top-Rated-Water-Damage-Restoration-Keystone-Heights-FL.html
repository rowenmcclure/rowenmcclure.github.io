<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, drifting through the air till they land somewhere. Think of planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the exact same method, so if the location the spores land is good and wet, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a big problem on your hands.</p>

<p>Recent Review: I needed an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the water company informed me if it's going at the present rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, however when he found out just how much water costs I was paying given that the leakage started, he accepted help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the place of the leakage for me and then even assisted me closed down my primary water valve. Very polite and easy-going person.</p>

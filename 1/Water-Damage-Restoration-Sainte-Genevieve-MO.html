<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. In some cases it will be apparent that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls might show visible indications of moisture, dripping water, or signs of failing structural integrity. Ceiling drywall panels may crumble or sag under the weight of water that fills the naturally permeable gypsum material. Other times, you might see small signs like coffee-colored stains that might expand in time.</p>
<p>Water damage occurs from damaged pipelines, blocked drains pipes, malfunctioning home appliances, storms, fire damage, and other causes. The proper treatment depends upon the nature of the damage. Some water brings contaminants and must be considered dangerous. Whatever the origin, the prospects for restoration depend largely on the speed with which your building and personal effects can be dried. Even clean water can create mildew and other bacterial development if overlooked.</p>

If the outside humidity ends up being greater than inside, close things up; also, close up your home over night if temperature levels drop and moist air might otherwise be drawn inside.

<p>Mold can trigger severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. An automatic shut-off valve is exceptional insurance coverage to have in any scenario, especially when the water heater system is located inside the home. Damage from water leaking out of your hot water heater is imminent unless repaired quickly, and the costs go up the longer the issue goes uncorrected. The perpetrator may have been something as basic as a pressure relief valve requiring changing or something catastrophic like a tank failure.</p>
<p>To avoid mold and practice appropriate cooking area maintenance, open windows to enhance ventilation and run the hood vent when cooking and cleaning. Clean water from hard surfaces, and repair dripping faucets as soon as possible. Constantly ensure your tableware and serving dishes are dry before saving them to keep mold from multiplying in cabinets. Scrub mold from surface areas as soon as it appears, then make sure to dry the area to prevent it from spreading.</p>

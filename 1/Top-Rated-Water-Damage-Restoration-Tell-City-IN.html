<p>We called them out to evaluate water damage in our cooking area after we found our faucet was leaking. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and transported away everything else.  We were extremely happy that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they came back the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.  I could not think they got a lot done in one day!  Somebody has actually come out each day to check in and I feel confident in their understanding and abilities to do the job effectively. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>

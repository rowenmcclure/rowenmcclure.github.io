<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart offers us with the tools to evaluate which drying equipment or methods will be the most efficient. It is essential to identify if conditions are attainable within the drying chamber based upon the outside temperature level and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating unit. These conditions can assist in determining what devices to utilize on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, latent and sensible energy, can be calculated by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Examination Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula accurately predicts the energy examination of ambient air and its relationship to multiple building products and how they respond to each one and provide the best evaporation results. The higher the number, the quicker materials will dry. Utilizing this formula, desiccants are more useful if the outdoors grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>

Utilizing bleach on visible mold growth is NOT recommended by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Standard for Expert Mold Remediation.

<p>Mold (American English) or mould (British English), also sometimes referred to as mildew, is a fungal growth that develops on wet products. Mold is a natural part of the environment and plays a vital part in nature by breaking down dead organic matter such as fallen leaves and dead trees; inside, mold development should be prevented. Mold reproduce by methods of small spores. The spores resemble seeds, but invisible to the naked eye, that drift through the air and deposit on surface areas. When the temperature level, moisture, and readily available nutrient conditions are right, the spores can form into brand-new mold nests where they are deposited. 1 There are lots of types of mold, however all need moisture and a food source for growth.</p>

One product we use is MMR, an industrial grade tool that gets deep beneath the external layer to damage mold. Furthermore, we deal with the discolorations often caused by a mold growth. Mold can stain things like wood as it grows, leaving permanent cosmetic damage even after it is gone. MMR assists Mold Solutions NW address stain issues along with mold development by getting under the surface area on impacted areas.</p>
<p>Prior to making any repairs, you need to discover the source of the water leak. This can be frustrating, but if you don't fix the source of the water problem initially, repairs will do you no good. Whether it's a dripping roof, a broken pipeline or dripping toilet, it can often be tough to find the source. Water can take a trip far from the leakage and trigger damage somewhere you wouldn't expect it. This means you have to do some expedition and examination. Eliminate damaged drywall so that you can better see where the leak is coming from (see Step 2) and so you can dry out the water-damaged area.</p>

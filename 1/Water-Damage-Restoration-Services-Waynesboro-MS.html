Mold on the outside of your house isn't just unattractive - it can also eventually move to the interior and cause further damage.

Also, since it's in the air, it's almost difficult to consist of. Even after a fire is offed, smoke in the air can trigger damage.

<p>When water damage happens, the most likely offender is a failure in the plumbing. Sadly, the damage water can cause is fast-moving, lasting, and generally quite serious.

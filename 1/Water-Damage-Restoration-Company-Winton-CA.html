<p>Mold can trigger serious health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown ineffective against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>To eliminate mold in the basement, scrub the walls using a big brush, and bear in mind that permeable surface areas such as ceiling tiles or drywall might need to be eliminated and changed. If basement carpet has actually ended up being musty, sweep it (while wearing a mask) to loosen up the mold and let it dry in the sun if you can move it, or utilize high-powered fans to get rid of wetness if it's attached to the floor.</p>

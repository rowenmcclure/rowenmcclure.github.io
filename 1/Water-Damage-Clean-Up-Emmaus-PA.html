Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he discovered just how much water expense I was paying because the leakage began, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He marked the area & discovered of the leakage for me and after that even helped me shut down my main water valve.

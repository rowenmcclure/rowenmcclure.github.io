<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become wet or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins exist, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in materials that have become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being airborne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being airborne.</p>

<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation product that mold experts generally advise is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of hot water. Use the option on the surface area affected by mold and scrub the location with a carpet or brush until the mold vanishes. There's no need to rinse it off due to the fact that borax will keep the mold from coming back. Nevertheless, do not utilize this cleaner on porous surface areas like drywall. Such materials soak up water easily. This might exacerbate the issue because as you know - mold likes wet environments.<p>

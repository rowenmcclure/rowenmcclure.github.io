<p>Whether it takes place in your ceiling because of a dripping roofing system, condensation from your central air conditioning, or flooding, fixing water-damaged drywall can cause you anxiety and stress, specifically if you've never done it previously. Mold requires simply three things to grow and survive: humidity, darkness and moisture. The most typical locations in your house for mold growth are basements, showers, around heating and cooling devices, ducts, crawlspaces and carpets. The best way to prevent mold development is to get rid of water leaks or wetness in your home. See our post, How Do I Avoid Mold Growth?" for mold prevention pointers.</p>

Do not blend bleach with ammonia cleaners or acids, because an unsafe chlorine gas may be formed.</p>

We use tools like plastic sheeting and air scrubbers to discover additional mold development. Our experts will make sure that the remediation process doesn't enable the mold to spread. We don't desire spores to get away during the process and possibly enter other parts of the home or building where they can grow again.</p>

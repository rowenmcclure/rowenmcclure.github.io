<p>Smoke damage is a common side effect of fire damage, but it can take place on its own if a fire is included. A number of hundred lawsuits submitted in the last five years allege that the majority of these homes consist of lots of violations of the state-mandated building regulations that ultimately allowed water to drain pipes into both new and renovated homes. Many houses with water damage lack basic weatherproofing materials, inspection reports say. Coats of stucco are typically too thin. According to a suit by the owners of a $1.96 million Center City townhouse, workmanship was so bad that, even prior to the household moved in, a mushroom grew in the floorboard of their 20-month-old kid's bedroom.</p>

<p>The Inquirer found that in many cases, moisture may have dripped in from day one. Beneath apparently unblemished exteriors made of various materials-- brick, stucco, vinyl siding, stone, fiber cement board, and more-- water has damaged whatever from window sills to insulation that as soon as puffed like pink cotton candy. In some cases, wood sheathing is so saturated that it now flakes easily, falling apart into mulch-like chips. Mold, termites, and phorid flies have infested some walls.</p>
<p>Hydrogen peroxide kills mold as it is anti-fungal along with anti-bacterial and anti-viral. Hydrogen peroxide is a great option to chlorine bleach because it is safe to use and doesn't damage the environment, nor does it leave behind hazardous residue or produce hazardous fumes like chlorine bleach does. You can buy hydrogen peroxide from drug shops for around one dollar for a bottle of 3% concentration.</p>

Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, however when he learnt just how much water bill I was paying given that the leak started, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the location of the leakage for me and after that even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Extremely polite and easy-going person.</p>

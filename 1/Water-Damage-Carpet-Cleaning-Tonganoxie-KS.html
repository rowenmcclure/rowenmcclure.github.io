Look for noticeable mold growth (it may look cottony, silky, rough, or leathery and have various colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold typically appears as a staining or fuzzy development on furniture or building materials (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper). Try to find indications of wetness or water damage (water leakages, standing water, water spots, condensation, etc.).</p>
<p>Crawl areas often grow mold for the same factors as basements do-they tend to stay damp long-term. They're smaller sized than basements, however, and normally have more ventilation, so they do not tend to have as big a mold growth area, making common costs better to $500 for remediation. Because of the size and ventilation, cleanup in this location is generally less extreme, so cleaning and removing affected areas is frequently sufficient.</p>

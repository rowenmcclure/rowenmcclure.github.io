If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. You will likely end up with a really expensive paperweight if this deterioration procedure is not stopped.</p>

<p>Some air cleaners are developed to produce ozone which is a strong oxidizing agent and a recognized irritant of the lungs and respiratory system. Research studies have revealed that ozone, even at high concentrations, is not effective at killing airborne mold or surface mold contamination.

Health experts, including the Minnesota Department of Health, do not advise using ozone to address mold or any other indoor air problems.</p>

As soon as the water has actually been eliminated and everything is dry, the restoration company may go through and do a last cleaning that includes sterilizing to get rid of the possibility of bacterial growth and ventilating to rid the home or office of any undesirable odors due to the water damage.<p>
<p>Smoke-damaged books and files are generally disposed of. Internal Revenue Service Restoration recovers paper items through a process of freeze drying to remove lingering smoke smells. Whatever that entered into contact with flood water will need to be disinfected. If the water consisted of sewage or other dangerous materials, you should dispose of any permeable products it touched and ensure everything else is completely sterilized. Do this as soon as possible to prevent mold growth.<p>
<p>If you're working with a smaller hole (approximately 6"), use a thin layer of joint compound around the hole. Position your spot into the hole. Utilizing a putty knife, work the paper edge down into the compound. Plume the edges of the substance and allow it to dry. Sand lightly with a fine-grit sandpaper and use a 2nd layer of joint compound to end up the repair. As water and storm damage professionals, we have the experience and advanced training that enables us to restore your property quickly. We use clinical drying principles and provide recognition and paperwork that your residential or commercial property is dry and the task is total.<p>

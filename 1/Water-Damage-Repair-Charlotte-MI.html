Part of our tracking procedure includes examining ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily dependent on temperature too, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can likewise set a drying job back days.

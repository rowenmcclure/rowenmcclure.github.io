<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you may not know is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown inadequate versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually helps with mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>

We have both a license and comprehensive training in completing these tasks and constantly work towards a restore over replace approach.

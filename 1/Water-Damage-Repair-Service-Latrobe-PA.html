<p>If smoke and fire damage has actually impacted your possessions, we will work with you and your insurance provider to identify what can be restored, and what will be an insurance replacement claim. For items that can be restored, we utilize ultrasonic cleaning to restore your damaged valuables. For this, we utilized Zinsser's Water Based Peel-Stop What this does is imitate a glue which permeates into permeable surface area, avoiding water from seeping back through. Essentially, it makes the location strong again and protects the surface from future water damage. After you have actually used the Peel-Stop, enable an hour of drying time.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our cooking area after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living-room and carried away whatever else.  We were really happy that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they came back the next service day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.  I could not think they got so much performed in one day!  Somebody has actually come out every day to sign in and I feel confident in their knowledge and abilities to finish the job appropriately. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>

Experts have identified Pennsylvania the center of an industrywide epidemic that has actually impacted sprawling rural homes, starter houses, and high-end Philadelphia townhouses alike.

Some are 10 or twenty years old. Others are brand-new.</p>

<p>Jake (and his group) are amazing to deal with. They were quick to respond at first and offered a fair and sensible  quote. They were able to fit us into their schedule quickly and get the work done very quickly. Our mold concern ended up being smaller sized than first thought so the last billing showed the actual work needed and was less than first priced quote. Jake was very responsive to calls and emails responding to questions throughout the process. All in all, I had a great experience with Jake and Carolina Water Damage Restoration.</p>
<p>When your home floods, the water can damage the structure of your house, your personal belongings, and the health of the inside environment. Flood waters consist of lots of contaminants and lots of mud. High dollar items can get destroyed simultaneously, even with just an inch of water, for instance: carpets, wallboard, devices, and furnishings. A more extreme storm or much deeper flood might add damage to much more costly systems, like: ducts, the heater and a/c, roof, personal sewage and well systems, utilities, and the structure.</p>

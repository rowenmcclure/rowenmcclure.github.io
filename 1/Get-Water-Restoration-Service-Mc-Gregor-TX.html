<p>Mold can trigger serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that most chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown ineffective versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Mold (American English) or mould (British English), likewise in some cases described as mildew, is a fungal growth that develops on wet materials. Mold is a natural part of the environment and plays an important part in nature by breaking down dead raw material such as fallen leaves and dead trees; indoors, mold growth must be prevented. Mold reproduce by means of small spores. The spores resemble seeds, however invisible to the naked eye, that float through the air and deposit on surfaces. When the temperature level, wetness, and available nutrient conditions are right, the spores can form into new mold colonies where they are deposited. 1 There are numerous types of mold, however all need moisture and a food source for development.</p>

Tidy up includes scrubbing down the affected areas, utilizing dehumidifiers to dry the area, and air scrubbers to help remove spores.</p>
<p>Lastly, we wish to attend to making use of bleach on mold. Utilizing bleach on noticeable mold growth is NOT suggested by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Requirement for Expert Mold Remediation. Initially, bleach is a chemical and can impact people with chemical sensitivities especially if used in locations that are not well ventilated.

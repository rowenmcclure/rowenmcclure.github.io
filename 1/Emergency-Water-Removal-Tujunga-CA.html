<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing big repair work. By reducing the density here, it's easier to hide long taped seams under several coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed look, it is essential to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Likewise remember that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is completed, this helps reinforce the strength of the wall and assists break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even.<p>
<p>The last and essential part of how to get rid of mold is drying the surface. Keep in mind that wetness is the primary cause of mold accumulation. These fungis like the humid, wet environment. Because you will be cleaning mold with water, the surface will be damp for a time period. Aim to accelerate the drying process by ventilating the location. If possible and run a dehumidifier, open windows and doors. You can also use air movers to quickly dry the surface area.<p>

Additionally, mold can cause structural damage to your home, possibly leading to significant repairs and lowered value. That's why the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has stated that any mold must be eliminated, no matter the type.<p>

There are over 100,000 types of species of mold, but the most common kinds of mold grow within 3-5 days. After a mold spore lands on a food source that is damp and warm, it starts to sprout and colonize within 24-48 hours. Hyphae or roots start to grow into the food source and mycotoxins or poisonous gasses are launched as the fungis spreads. Mold in your home can be extremely dangerous and cause a range of health issues. If the mold in your house is not eliminated effectively it can continue to grow, making effective mold remediation more expensive and hard.<p>

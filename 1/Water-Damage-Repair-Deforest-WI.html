<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be more convenient due to the fact that it is self-adhesive, lots of professional drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I prefer paper tape, too. However, paper tape isn't always practical. Using paper tape requires some practice and little skill, however it's well worth learning.

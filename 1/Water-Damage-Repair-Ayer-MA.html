<p>Mold can cause major health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. An automated shut-off valve is outstanding insurance to have in any situation, particularly when the hot water heater system is located inside the home. Damage from water leaking out of your hot water heater is imminent unless repaired rapidly, and the costs go up the longer the issue goes uncorrected. The offender might have been something as basic as a pressure relief valve needing replacing or something catastrophic like a tank failure.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that common building products can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is typically related to water or wetness direct exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

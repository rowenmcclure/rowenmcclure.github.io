<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, drifting through the air until they land somewhere. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the very same way, so if the location the spores land is good and moist, mold can start to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a big issue on your hands.</p>

<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be more convenient since it is self-adhesive, many professional drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I prefer paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't always hassle-free. Using paper tape needs some practice and little skill, but it's well worth learning. When the meters read wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the professional will eliminate the fans and dehumidifiers from the location.

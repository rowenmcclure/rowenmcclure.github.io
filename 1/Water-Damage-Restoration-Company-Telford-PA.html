<p>Mold can trigger major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. Juice 3 to 5 lemons and put over afflicted area. Let it sit for 5 minutes, and then clean it away with a moist towel. Just like a few of the above techniques, you can use a tooth brush to scrub at the issue zone if you feel like the towel isn't working all right. For optimal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any meal or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will include a little extra heft to the mold-removal process.</p>
<p>Because the plaster drywall is permeable and soluble in water, getting it damp can develop into a major headache. Wet drywall will soak up water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in location.

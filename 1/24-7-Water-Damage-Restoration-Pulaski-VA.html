These 10 steps get you on the roadway to flooded restroom recovery. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the surface area to raise and agitate the dampened mold. Move the brush in cautious strong strokes so you aren't splashing the mold on the surrounding areas-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health issue. After scrubbing thoroughly with the brush, wipe the location clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>

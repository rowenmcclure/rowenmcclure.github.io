While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this means that the smoke will spread, harming a much wider location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is enabled to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration methods will involve searching a wide location to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>

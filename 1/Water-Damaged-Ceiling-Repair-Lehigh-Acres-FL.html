<p>Any building that has actually experienced water damage or issues with excess moisture is at danger of mold growth. Wear a facemask or a respirator rated for black mold spore defense, and cover legs, arms and hands to avoid contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to eliminate noticeable mold.

Next, utilize industrial black mold removal products, which can be found in many hardware or home repair shops, to sanitize the moldy areas, in addition to any nearby locations.

Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, however when he learnt just how much water costs I was paying since the leak began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the place & found of the leakage for me and after that even helped me closed down my primary water valve.

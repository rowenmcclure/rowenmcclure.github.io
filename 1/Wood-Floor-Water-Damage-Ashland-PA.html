<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is in fact made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Lots of people think that since smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it simply disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this means that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much larger location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration approaches will involve browsing a large area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>

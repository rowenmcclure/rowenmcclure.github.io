Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>

<p>Drywall is really a panel of plaster (calcium sulfate dihydrate) that is sandwiched between 2 types of paper (one is a light-colored facer, the other the darker backer). It was very first appeared in the U.S. in 1916 when United States Plaster Corporation put out a product called Sheetrock" indicated to be a non-warping, non-burning wall covering.

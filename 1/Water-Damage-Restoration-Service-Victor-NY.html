<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences.

If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the very same way, so if the location the spores land is great and damp, mold can begin to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a huge issue on your hands.</p>

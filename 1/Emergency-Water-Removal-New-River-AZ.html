<p>Smoke damage is a typical adverse effects of fire damage, but it can occur by itself if a fire is contained. Desiccant dehumidifiers - This kind of dehumidifier develops the lowest humidity ratio. Desiccant dehumidifiers absorb wetness through chemical tourist attraction instead of condensation to eliminate water from the air. A desiccant is a product that holds and attracts moisture. This product acts like a sponge drawing wetness from the air (sorption). When the wheel turns through heated exhaust air, the moisture evaporates (desorption) and is brought outdoors. Then the cycle repeats.</p>

We also installed portable heating fans to accelerate the drying process.</p>

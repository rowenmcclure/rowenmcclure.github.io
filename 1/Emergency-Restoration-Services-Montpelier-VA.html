The humidity is the temperature level the air needs to be cooled to, at continuous pressure, in order to accomplish an RH if 100%. At this point the air can not hold more water in gas kind. If the air were to be cooled much more, water vapor would have to come out of the atmosphere in a liquid form. The higher the dew point increases, the higher the amount of moisture in the air.</p>

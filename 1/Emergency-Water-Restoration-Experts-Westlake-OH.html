We stumbled upon it while helping a reader with a Recreational Vehicle water damage repair. Not just does it do a fantastic job of revealing you the damage that water can do to a Recreational Vehicle, the creator also demonstrates how to repair the damage step by step.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum: this mold is typically described as black mold or harmful mold because of the mycotoxins that it can give off. This mold can be damaging to your health in the form of chronic sinus infections, asthma, and tiredness. It grows in areas that remain constantly wet, like a/c systems. In addition to being hazardous, black mold can also stain surface areas it grows on, which can make it more difficult to effectively remove. Often, surfaces with black mold may need additional whitening or replacement to deal with the spots. In some cases, an encapsulating agent might be necessary to cover the stain and any staying spores.</p>

<p>As moisture is released in the air, nature always attempts to reach balance. Determining the humidity is very important in drying because when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surface areas. The dew point always occurs at 100% relative humidity (RH). The humidity is the temperature the air requires to be cooled to, at continuous pressure, in order to attain an RH if 100%. At this moment the air can not hold more water in gas type. If the air were to be cooled a lot more, water vapor would need to come out of the atmosphere in a liquid form. The higher the humidity rises, the greater the amount of wetness in the air.</p>

Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>

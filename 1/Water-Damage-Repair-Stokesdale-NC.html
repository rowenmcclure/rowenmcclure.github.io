Mold replicate by means of small spores. The spores resemble seeds, however unnoticeable to the naked eye, that float through the air and deposit on surfaces. When the temperature level, moisture, and available nutrient conditions are appropriate, the spores can form into brand-new mold nests where they are deposited. 1 There are lots of types of mold, however all require moisture and a food source for growth.</p>

<p>Get rid of wallboard, plaster and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be an irreversible health threat and ought to be gotten rid of.

A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the suggestion of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>

If there is a lot of mold growth, consult the U.S. Epa's guidance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Structures ".  variations of these and other assistance files are readily available on the EPA's Publications on Mold web page If the musty product is not easily cleanable, such as drywall, carpet padding and insulation, then removal and replacement might be necessary.<p>

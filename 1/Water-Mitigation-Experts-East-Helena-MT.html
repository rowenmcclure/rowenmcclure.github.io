Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was already complete, but when he discovered how much water bill I was paying since the leakage started, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the devices. He marked the place & discovered of the leak for me and after that even helped me shut down my primary water valve.

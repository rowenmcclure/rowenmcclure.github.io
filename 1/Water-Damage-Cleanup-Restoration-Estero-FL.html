<p>One day, I came home from work thinking I 'd be able to unwind.

<p>It is primarily standing water that triggers mold formation. It can leak into porous surface areas, and those materials can end up being reproducing grounds for destructive molds and fungus.

<p>One reason is that bleach can not totally kill mold growing in permeable materials. The chlorine in bleach can not permeate into permeable surfaces such as drywall or wood. The chlorine is left on the surface area of permeable materials and just the water part of the bleach is absorbed into the product, providing more wetness for the mold to feed upon.

<p>Numerous extremely contagious illnesses are linked to water damage including skin infections, liver disease A, salmonella, eye infections, respiratory infections, and Weil's disease, as well as liver, kidney, and blood concerns. A few of the mold on the surface may be eliminated but the roots of the mold are left undamaged implying the mold quickly returns, leaving you in a cycle of repeated lightening. Possibly this is why some people believe that spraying bleach on mold does not impact it but instead just bleaches its color so you can no longer see it.<p>

<p>Water invasion into structures can be exceptionally destructive. Jake and his guys were fantastic in helping us make it through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to your house and started drying out our soaked crawlspace immediately. They came back every day (often two times a day) to keep track of and change the dehumidifiers and fans to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained whatever they were doing along the way and likewise were extremely handy in collaborating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the costs and I 'd advise them without doubt.</p>

<p>Lastly, we wish to attend to making use of bleach on mold. Utilizing bleach on noticeable mold development is NOT advised by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Standard for Specialist Mold Remediation. First, bleach is a chemical and can affect people with chemical sensitivities especially if utilized in areas that are not well aerated. Second, on non-porous surface areas such as tile, bleach is no more efficient at getting rid of mold than a wet cloth and a mild detergent, so we advise the least hazardous option.</p>
<p>Current Review: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got an expense for $370, and the water company told me if it's going at the current rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, but when he discovered how much water bill I was paying since the leakage started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the place & discovered of the leak for me and after that even assisted me shut down my main water valve. Very courteous and easy-going person.</p>

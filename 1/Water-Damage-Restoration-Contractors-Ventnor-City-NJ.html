<p>Since the gypsum drywall is porous and soluble in water, getting it damp can develop into a major headache. Wet drywall will soak up water and grow heavy to manage from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the event where drywall does get wet and simply starts to sag prior to drying, fixing it may just require pushing it back into place, securing it with some brand-new screws, and then painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>

As drywall is available in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it simpler to change the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was greater than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material should be removed to a height of 8 feet or approximately the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>

<p>You want to attend to bathroom flooding as quickly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and develops an ideal breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew. These 10 steps get you on the road to flooded bathroom recovery. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the area to raise and unsettle the moistened mold. Move the brush in careful strong strokes so you aren't splashing the mold on the surrounding locations-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health concern. After scrubbing thoroughly with the brush, wipe the location clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
<p>Corroded pipes are a common incident after prolonged direct exposure to flood water. The deterioration makes them most likely to leakage or fracture. Also, water damage in electrical systems is costly to fix. Home appliances and fuses may not work appropriately after water exposure. In the worst cases, electrical fires might occur. Warranty- Many Water Damage Companies will not offer any assurance to remove mold damage.<p>

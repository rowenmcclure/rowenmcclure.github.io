<p>Air Cleaning: Instantly we gear up the home with air scrubbers. We typically will set one system for each 2 to 3 rooms, depending upon the size of the room. These systems have an intake and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the intake where it travels through three filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and licensed to 99.99% HEPA performance, which indicates that they eliminate a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has been cleaned up and much of the smell removed. This process goes on for days.

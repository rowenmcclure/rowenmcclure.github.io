The sort of wood floor covering you might have restricts the type and figures out of repairs that require to happen. Solid hardwood flooring allows for a broader variety of choices to repair the problem.

<p>Air Cleaning: Instantly we gear up the home with air scrubbers. We typically will set one system for each 2 to 3 rooms, depending upon the size of the room. These systems have an intake and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the intake where it travels through three filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and licensed to 99.99% HEPA performance, which indicates that they eliminate a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has been cleaned up and much of the smell removed. This process goes on for days. As you can picture, throughout a number of days, the air that is available in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and deodorizing treatments.</p>

<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation product that mold experts usually suggest is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry area. To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of hot water. Apply the option on the surface area affected by mold and scrub the area with a carpet or brush till the mold disappears. Due to the fact that borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no need to wash it off. However, do not utilize this cleaner on permeable surfaces like drywall. Such products soak up water easily. This might aggravate the issue due to the fact that as you know - mold loves wet environments.<p>

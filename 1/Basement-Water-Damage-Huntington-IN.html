If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a long-term health risk and need to be removed.

This develops a "chimney impact" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the suggestion of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>

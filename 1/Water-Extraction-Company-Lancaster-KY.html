<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart supplies us with the tools to evaluate which drying devices or methods will be the most efficient. It is imperative to figure out if conditions are attainable within the drying chamber based on the outdoors temperature level and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating unit. These conditions can assist in determining what equipment to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, sensible and latent energy, can be computed by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Examination Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula properly forecasts the energy evaluation of ambient air and its relationship to multiple structure products and how they respond to each one and offer the best evaporation outcomes. The higher the number, the faster products will dry. Utilizing this formula, desiccants are more valuable if the outdoors grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>

It is very important to quickly manage the wetness in the air and use enough air flow to dry the surface of products to lower water activity, thus decreasing the potential for microbial growth.

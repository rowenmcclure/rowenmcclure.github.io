<p>Experiencing a disaster that needs fire damage cleanup in your house or company is one of the most terrible things that can take place to a household or a person. To begin resolving a water damaged wall or ceiling in your house, you need to determine the source of the water.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or wet. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in products that have become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being airborne.</p>

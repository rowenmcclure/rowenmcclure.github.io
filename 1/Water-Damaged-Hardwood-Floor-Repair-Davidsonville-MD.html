Did you understand that smoke is really made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Lots of people believe that since smoke rises into the air, diffusion takes place, and it just goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this indicates that the smoke will spread, damaging a much larger area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is enabled to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration methods will involve searching a wide location to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>

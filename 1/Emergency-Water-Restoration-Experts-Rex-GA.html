Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

<p>Completely shake the spray bottle of mold-mitigating solution, then spray the afflicted area so it's well-saturated. (Continue to shake the bottle repeatedly throughout this procedure in order to guarantee the solution stays well mixed.)

Never ever scrape dried mold, or else the poisonous spores could spread into air and cause negative health effects.</p>

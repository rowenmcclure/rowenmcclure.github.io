When MacBook water damage has actually occurred, the liquid will likely make its way to the reasoning board and other parts.

This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually rusting. If there is a power source available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration procedure.

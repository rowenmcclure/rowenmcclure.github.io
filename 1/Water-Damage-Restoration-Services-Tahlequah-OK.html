Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, but when he discovered how much water costs I was paying considering that the leakage started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He marked the place & discovered of the leak for me and after that even helped me closed down my main water valve.

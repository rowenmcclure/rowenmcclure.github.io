<p>The devices we utilize can running for days without being turned off (it will not get too hot), and unless we recommend you otherwise, it is best to leave it on and running at all times till the job is finished.

<p>As soon as standing water is gotten rid of, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has soaked up (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) get rid of the moisture in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure includes inspecting ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature level as well, so cooling a space down with outside air can also set a drying job back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service professionals prior to you make any modifications if you have concerns on this.</p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I needed an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's going at the present rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, but when he discovered just how much water bill I was paying since the leakage started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the devices. He marked the location & found of the leakage for me and after that even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Very polite and easy-going individual.</p>

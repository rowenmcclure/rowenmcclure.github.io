Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already complete, however when he found out just how much water expense I was paying since the leakage began, he accepted help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the location & discovered of the leak for me and after that even helped me closed down my main water valve. Very polite and easy-going individual.<p>

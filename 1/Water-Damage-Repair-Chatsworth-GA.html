Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.

<h3>Fire and Smoke Damage Restoration in Chatsworth</h3>
<p>Remove wallboard, plaster and paneling to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be an irreversible health threat and must be gotten rid of if soaked by polluted floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use just the pointer of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>

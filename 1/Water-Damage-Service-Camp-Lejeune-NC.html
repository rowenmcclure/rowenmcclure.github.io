Part of our monitoring process includes examining ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly depending on temperature too, so cooling a space down with outside air can also set a drying project back days.

<h3>Water & Fire Damage Restoration in Camp Lejeune</h3>
<p>Get rid of plaster, wallboard and paneling to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be an irreversible health danger and should be gotten rid of if soaked by contaminated floodwater.

This produces a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the suggestion of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>

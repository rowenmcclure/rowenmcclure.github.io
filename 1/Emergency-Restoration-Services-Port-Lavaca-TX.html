<p>Water invasion into structures can be incredibly harmful. Jake and his guys were remarkable in helping us make it through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They fasted to get to your home and started drying out our drenched crawlspace right away. They came back every day (often twice a day) to keep track of and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained everything they were doing along the way and also were extremely handy in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than fair on the expenses and I 'd suggest them without doubt.</p>
<p>Daily moisture readings ought to be consisted of in the drying record to include devices, heating and cooling, and air systems. Wetness material levels for wet structural products should be recorded in a moisture content spreadsheet to reveal the progress of drying These tape-recorded wetness content readings will show that the structure is back to an acceptable variety of pre-loss condition. It is important to understand that air records alone will not prove that a structure is dry. After 24 hr the psychrometric conditions will show if enough dehumidification is being used or if changes are required.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing big repair work. By reducing the density here, it's much easier to hide long taped joints under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is essential to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Likewise keep in mind that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is completed, this helps enhance the strength of the wall and assists break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even.<p>

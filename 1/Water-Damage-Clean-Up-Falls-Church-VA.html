<p>Because common building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is usually related to water or moisture direct exposure and might be brought on by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

Did you know that smoke is in fact made from little particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does.

While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this means that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much larger area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is enabled to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration methods will include searching a broad area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>

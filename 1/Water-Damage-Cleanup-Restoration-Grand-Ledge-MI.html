<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health issues through air-borne pathogens. Experts have labeled Pennsylvania the center of an industrywide epidemic that has actually impacted stretching rural houses, starter homes, and high-end Philadelphia townhouses alike. Characteristics built with products besides stucco had issues, too. Some houses with water damage were developed by billion-dollar public companies. Others, by little, local companies. Some are 10 or 20 years old. Others are new.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or moist. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in materials that have ended up being contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming airborne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being airborne.</p>

<p>Mold can cause major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have been proven ineffective against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact facilitates mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Our team will come out to your home to check and examine the fire and smoke damage that has actually happened. As soon as dry-out is total, our approach to fire damage cleanup and smoke damage removal begins with cutting-edge ventilation technology to clean out your home and get rid of particles drifting in the air.

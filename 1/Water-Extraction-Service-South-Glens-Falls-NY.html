The CDC recommends that you use long trousers and a long-sleeve shirt, protective gloves and glasses, waterproof boots, and a mask rated at least N-95 or more to protect your nose and mouth. Keep in mind that while these masks safeguard you from small particles like mold, they are not appropriate if you are coming across any sort of gases, chemical vapors, asbestos or lead.</p>

<p>The equipment we use can running for days without being turned off (it will not get too hot), and unless we recommend you otherwise, it is best to leave it on and running at perpetuity until the task is completed.

Initially, bleach is a chemical and can affect individuals with chemical sensitivities especially if used in locations that are not well ventilated. Second, on non-porous surfaces such as tile, bleach is no more reliable at removing mold than a moderate detergent and a damp cloth, so we suggest the least toxic alternative.</p>

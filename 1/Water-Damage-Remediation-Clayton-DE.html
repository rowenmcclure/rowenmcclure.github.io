Craig Hawkins and his group at Enviroshield have more than twenty years of experience in water damage and mold remediation. They're licensed, use a nationally acknowledged protocol and supply a 25-year assurance on all work.

<p>We work and live in this community too; we might even be neighbors. As a locally owned and run business, SERVPRO of Platte County is nearby and all set to react to storm and disaster events. We are proud to be an active member of the Kansas City neighborhood and wish to do our part to make our community the best it can be. Always make certain you use an independent, third party screening firm, which if you use a mold remediation company, that they use a third party testing company themselves. Testing agencies must not offer any details on how to deal with the concern, or charge you for remediation; they must just check the mold and inform you what it is.<p>
<p>If you're working with a smaller sized hole (as much as 6"), apply a thin layer of joint substance around the hole. Put your spot into the hole. Using a putty knife, work the paper edge down into the compound. Feather the edges of the compound and enable it to dry. Sand lightly with a fine-grit sandpaper and apply a 2nd layer of joint compound to complete the repair. As water and storm damage specialists, we have the experience and advanced training that allows us to restore your property quickly. We use clinical drying concepts and provide recognition and documents that your property is dry and the task is total.<p>
<p>Rusty pipes are a typical event after extended exposure to flood water. The rust makes them most likely to leakage or crack. Also, water damage in electrical systems is pricey to fix. Appliances and fuses may not work effectively after water exposure. In the worst cases, electrical fires might occur. Assurance- Most Water Damage Companies will not use any assurance to get rid of mold damage.<p>

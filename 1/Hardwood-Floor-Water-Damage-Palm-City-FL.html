<p>Mold can cause severe health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inefficient against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really facilitates mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Water damage develops from damaged pipes, obstructed drains, malfunctioning home appliances, storms, fire damage, and other causes. The suitable treatment depends on the nature of the damage. Some water brings pollutants and need to be thought about harmful.

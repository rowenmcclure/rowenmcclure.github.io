There may be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process consists of examining ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly depending on temperature also, so cooling a space down with outside air can likewise set a drying project back days.

<p>Due to the fact that large pieces of drywall need to be anchored to wall studs or ceiling joists, damaged locations bigger than 12 square inches may need a complete replacement panel set up. It depends upon where the damage is located on the wall or ceiling and how you needed to cut it out. For example, if the space where you got rid of the damaged drywall exposes studs or joists where it will be possible to protect a spot by screwing it into the stud or joist, you can do that. If not, you may have to replace the whole drywall panel.</p>

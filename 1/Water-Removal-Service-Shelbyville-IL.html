<p>Since the plaster drywall is permeable and soluble in water, getting it damp can turn into a significant headache. Wet drywall will absorb water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the case where drywall does get wet and simply begins to sag prior to drying, repairing it may simply require pushing it back into place, protecting it with some new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>

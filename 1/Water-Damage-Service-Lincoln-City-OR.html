<p>Mold can trigger major health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. Experts have actually labeled Pennsylvania the center of an industrywide epidemic that has actually impacted sprawling suburban houses, starter houses, and high-end Philadelphia townhouses alike. Characteristics constructed with materials other than stucco had problems, too. Some houses with water damage were constructed by billion-dollar public companies. Others, by little, local companies.

<p>Since common building products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally connected to water or moisture exposure and might be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, usually condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>

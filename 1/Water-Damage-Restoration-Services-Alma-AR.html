<p>Fire Damage is the most terrible sort of home damage that a family or company can experience. Once MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other components. The liquid's minerals and salts right away begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Often, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and then stop working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and slowly rusting. If there is a source of power available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this rust process. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. If this corrosion process is not stopped, you will likely end up with a very pricey paperweight.</p>

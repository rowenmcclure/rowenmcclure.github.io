Porous products like ceiling tiles, insulation drywall and fabric are typically removed. Semi-Porous non-Removable products like wood and concrete can be cleaned with HEPA vacuum, abrasive sanding and hand cleaning. Our specialists will then press clean all impacted non-porous and semi-porous structure materials, such as cement, tile, and wood.

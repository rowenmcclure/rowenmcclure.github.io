<p>Current Review: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility told me if it's addressing the present rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, however when he discovered just how much water bill I was paying because the leakage began, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the location of the leakage for me and after that even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Easy-going and extremely courteous individual.</p>

<p>Fire Damage is the most destructive sort of property damage that a household or service can experience. When MacBook water damage has actually happened, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other parts. The liquid's salts and minerals immediately begin to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Typically, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then stop working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and slowly rusting. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will interact with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process. This causes the copper and other metals to move across the board. If this corrosion procedure is not stopped, you will likely end up with a very expensive paperweight.</p>

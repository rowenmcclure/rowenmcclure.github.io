<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or moist. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in products that have actually become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being airborne.</p>

<p>Mold can trigger major health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. Juice 3 to five lemons and pour over affected area. Let it sit for 5 minutes, and after that wipe it away with a moist towel. Similar to a few of the above techniques, you can utilize a toothbrush to scrub at the problem zone if you seem like the towel isn't working all right.

<p>Recent Review: We called them out to examine water damage in our kitchen area after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and carried away everything else.  We were extremely happy that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really expert and hardworking.  I could not believe they got so much done in one day!  Someone has come out every day to sign in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to finish the job effectively. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>

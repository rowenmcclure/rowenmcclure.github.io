<p>We called them out to examine water damage in our kitchen after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living-room and carried away everything else.  We were very happy that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they came back the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely expert and hardworking.  I could not think they got so much carried out in one day!  Someone has come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their understanding and capabilities to get the job done appropriately.

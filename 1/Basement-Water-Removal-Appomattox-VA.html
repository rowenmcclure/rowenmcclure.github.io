<p>Test garments before utilizing any treatment, and follow the producer's guidelines. Smoke smell and soot can in some cases be washed from clothes that can be bleached. Measure 4 to 6 tbsp. Tri-Sodium Phosphate and 1 cup home cleaner or chlorine bleach for every gallon of warm water you will utilize. Alternatively, think about washing clothes in cold water with your usual home laundry detergent, and adding one tablespoon of pure vanilla extract.</p>
<p>Lastly, we want to resolve the use of bleach on mold. Using bleach on noticeable mold growth is NOT advised by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Standard for Expert Mold Remediation.

Second, on non-porous surface areas such as tile, bleach is no more efficient at removing mold than a wet fabric and a mild detergent, so we advise the least toxic option.</p>
<p>A good way to avoid mold from growing in your home is to decrease humidity and condensation. After a rainy Seattle day, inspect your home for leakages. If water does enter your home, mop it up quickly and dry the area. Likewise, try to increase your home's ventilation by opening windows (when it's not drizzling, naturally) or positioning fans in your room. And keep your indoor humidity below 60%.</p>

<p>Experiencing a disaster that needs fire damage cleanup in your house or organisation is one of the most terrible things that can happen to a household or an individual. Depending on the damage the hardwood floor may be repaired rather than being completely replaced. If there is minor damage then most of the floor can be saved and an isolated floorboard might require fixing. Nevertheless, if the damage is major then the entire floor may need replacing and sometimes even the subfloor too. The kind of wood floor covering you might have figures out and limits the type of repair work that need to happen. Strong hardwood floor covering enables a broader series of options to fix the problem. With solid hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away up to a quarter of an inch off the wood to remove water damage on the surface area. This kind of floor covering can also have replacements for individual planks. The very best method to take care of a water damaged location on your wood floor is to change the afflicted boards and after that refinish the whole floor to bring it back to a unifying appearance.</p>

<h3>Flood Restoration Equipment in Duluth Georgia</h2>
<p>Certain areas of your home such as crawl attics, spaces and basements are far more susceptible to water damage. Dark, moist crawl spaces can be a haven for mold and mildew, which is turn can then trigger structural damage as they flourish. The concrete structure of your home can cause dripping in the basement if there is moisture dripping through it. Condensation in the location in between the attic and your home can cause moisture on the underside of the roof, which can cause mold and decomposing. When inspecting your home for prospective causes of water damage make sure to look out for wetness in lighting fixtures as well as the general condition of any visible piping.</p>

All surfaces affected by water damage must be completely dried, cleaned up, decontaminated and deodorized by certified and skilled water restoration specialists in order to eliminate disease-causing germs, fungis and other viruses before the location is safe for humans again. The actual cleaning and drying time of your contents depends on the level of the water damage. While some clean-up efforts can take 2 days, many might take longer.</p>

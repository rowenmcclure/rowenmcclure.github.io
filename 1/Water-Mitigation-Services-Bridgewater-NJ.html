Onslaught is an EPA-registered, quaternary ammonium chloride cleaner, disinfectant, mildewstat, sanitizer, fungicide, and virucide designed for use on numerous surface areas based on microbial contamination. Onslaught is a focused formula that will sanitize hard, impermeable surfaces, and also sterilizes porous and semi-porous surface areas. Attack is particularly useful as an all-in-one product for dealing with wood structural members, carpets, and other permeable and nonporous surface areas as part of a total mold remediation job.</p>
<p>Since typical structure materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is typically associated with water or moisture direct exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor travels through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

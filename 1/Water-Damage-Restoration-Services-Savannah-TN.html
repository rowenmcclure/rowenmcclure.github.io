<h3>Facts About House Fire Damage You Need To Be Aware Of in Savannah</h3>
<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing large repairs. By lowering the density here, it's simpler to hide long taped seams under a number of coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed look, it's important to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps reinforce the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even when the task is finished.<p>

<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health concerns through airborne pathogens. Juice 3 to 5 lemons and pour over afflicted area. Let it sit for five minutes, and then wipe it away with a damp towel. Just like some of the above approaches, you can utilize a tooth brush to scrub at the problem zone if you feel like the towel isn't working well enough. For optimal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any dish or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will add a little additional heft to the mold-removal procedure.</p>
<p>If a pipe in your home has leaked for months and gone without repairs, mold can grow as an outcome, but it won't be covered by your homeowners insurance coverage. Given that floods can also trigger mold, any possible mold that grows as an outcome of a flood would be covered by flood insurance coverage, if you have it. Should you submit a claim for mold damage, this cause would be assessed and determined by the flood insurance coverage adjuster.</p>

<h3>Fire Damage Claims in Cordova - Tips for Filing an Insurance Claim</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing big repair work. By lowering the density here, it's much easier to conceal long taped joints under several coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is essential to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps enhance the strength of the wall and assists break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the job is finished.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen area after we found our faucet was leaking. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and carried away whatever else.  We were really happy that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.  I could not think they got a lot carried out in one day!  Someone has come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to do the job properly. I would suggest them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>If you're dealing with a smaller sized hole (up to 6"), use a thin layer of joint compound around the hole. Position your spot into the hole. Using a putty knife, work the paper edge down into the substance. Feather the edges of the compound and permit it to dry. Sand gently with a fine-grit sandpaper and apply a 2nd layer of joint compound to complete the repair. As water and storm damage experts, we have the experience and advanced training that allows us to restore your residential or commercial property quickly. We use scientific drying concepts and provide recognition and documentation that your residential or commercial property is dry and the task is complete.<p>

Get all of the excess moisture off with an absorbent fabric. Make sure to get the moisture out of the charging port, the volume keys, the earphone jack and any other crevices.<p>

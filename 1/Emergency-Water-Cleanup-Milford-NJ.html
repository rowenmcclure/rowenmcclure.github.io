<p>Recent Review: I needed an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility told me if it's addressing the current rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, but when he discovered how much water bill I was paying since the leakage began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the area of the leakage for me and then even assisted me closed down my main water valve. Easy-going and really courteous individual.</p>

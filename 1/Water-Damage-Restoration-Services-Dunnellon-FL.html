<p>A DIY mold remediation product that mold experts usually recommend is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of warm water. Apply the solution on the surface area impacted by mold and scrub the area with a carpet or brush up until the mold disappears. There's no requirement to rinse it off due to the fact that borax will keep the mold from returning. However, do not use this cleaner on porous surfaces like drywall. Such materials take in water easily. This might intensify the problem due to the fact that as you know - mold loves damp environments.<p>

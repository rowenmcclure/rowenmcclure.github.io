<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is really made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does. Many individuals believe that due to the fact that smoke increases into the air, diffusion happens, and it merely disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this means that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much broader area than the fire itself.

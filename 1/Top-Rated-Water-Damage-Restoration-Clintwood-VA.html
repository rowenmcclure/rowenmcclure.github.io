<p>Due to the fact that common structure products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is typically associated with water or moisture exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, generally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

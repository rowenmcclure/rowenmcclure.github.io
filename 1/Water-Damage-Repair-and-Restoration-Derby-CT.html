<p>Any structure that has suffered from water damage or issues with excess wetness is at risk of mold growth. Erosion to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to prolonged water exposure and needs masonry work to repair. Permanent staining on walls and floorings is another potential effect of water damage. Walls and floor covering might require replacement or refinishing depending upon the extent of damage. Moldy odors can remain in a home where leakages or flooding have happened and this could be indicative of excess mold and mildew development.</p>

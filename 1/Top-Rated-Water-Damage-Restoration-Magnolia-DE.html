Wear long sleeves and trousers to protect your skin. You should also use gloves and eye security. Since you will be releasing soot as you clean, it is essential to set floor defense and get rid of any furniture or family items that are not damaged. If the damaged location is little, you can most likely get away with merely covering furnishings with plastic or sheets.

Bear in mind the shoes you're using so you don't track soot discolorations into other rooms.<p>

By decreasing the thickness here, it's much easier to hide long taped seams under numerous coats of joint compound.

Likewise keep in mind that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps reinforce the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even when the task is completed.<p>
